"aapenko","nothing was found inside the folder. good luck next try. "
"aapenko","Looks good! The explanations were clear and helpful, one could tell that he knew what he was talking about. Impressive work, good luck further on!"
"aapenko","Well done project, all the definitions are properly explained. I really like the creative solution in Dockefile of WordPress! Keep it up!"
"aapenko","complete new world to me. seems pretty interresting. Solid explaination :) 👍"
"aapenko","I think this can help you. Please read it before you do next project https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners"
"aapenko","""warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository."" - Unlucky :( otherwise great and polite conversation "
"aapenko","Good job. Everything work as expected. The team is very polite and friendly, everyone knows what are they talking about. Good luck with next's projects!"
"aapenko","Thank you for showing me the project, they could explain it very well. Good luck with the next eval."
"aapenko","Great Job, well done. we tested every case in the subject and eval sheet, everything works good. Also answered all my questions! GJ"
"aapenko","unfortunately, the max nbr of connections was not checked, so after ~1017 connections, server didnt respond, clients couldnt send message.  also when the message was bigger than 4096 chars, it cut it."
"aapenko","Good job guys, server works  with different clients, commands are parsed correctly .. We tried different things and i liked it !!!"
"aapenko","Unfortunately empty repo, good luck next time!"
"aapenko","Hello,

 as expected you know how to use fork and how to make the tester not stop on segfault or any other kind of crash.

 The code is pretty simple and streight forward, so I cannot say much against that.

 Small confusion with the test folders but everything still worked out great. "
"aapenko","Cool project, everything works as expected. Eval sheet is really messed up for this project, it contradicts the PDF (PDF says 15 tests and now this one says 15 OK tests etc). But the things worked fine, nice job!"
"aapenko","Artem is able to explain everything in details, I really like the explanations, unfortunately he forgot to push his improved ex02. Better luck next time! "
"aapenko","Awesome, as always Artem knows his stuff, the explanations were very good and it was a pleasure to evaluate him. Thanks"
"aapenko","UNFORTUNATELY THE PEER FORGOT TO PUSH HIS WORK, THUS MISERABLY FAILING THIS PROJECT.
 I HOPE YOU ARE PROUD OF YOURSELF
 GOOD BYE"
"aapenko","sadly the repo is emtpy"
"aapenko","The peer forgot to upload the signature. Very inconsiderable of him."
"aapenko","good job! in btc many error cases handled. explained good."
"aapenko","Well done, readable code:)"
"aapenko","Unfortunately, bro we found some errors:
 Leap year doesnt work: 2004-02-29 | 1
 Date must be taken lower closest, not only closest one
 Other than that - outstanding! Good luck with resubmition!
 Удачи, очень жаль шо так вышло:("
"aapenko","Everything seems good."
"aapenko","great job explained the whole code perfectly amazing explanation unfortunately one function did not return the desired output"
"aapenko","Nice explanation! good know the syntax about cpp :) "
"aapenko","Well implemented code also explained every exercise. Unfortunately it was not clearly mentioned in the subject to create 2 functions for the iter function (ex0). It should also have one function for const.

 Good luck!"
"aapenko","Nicely done. Even though I don't know C++, he explained really well so that I understand. Good job."
"aapenko","identify should be one function but the goal of the exersize is the handling of casting with dynamic casting. Otherwise good. Thanks."
"aapenko","check all points, only have  a small problem, other good, checked also no memory leak, good work."
"aapenko","Well done project, only exception is not throwed in ex01, and an artifact in bureaucrat class. Good luck!"
"aapenko","Great job, even sound was implemented, the GUI version looks really nice. Wasn't able to beat the AI, as expected. Keep it up, guys!"
"aapenko","Very nice rush project! AI is very smart, i could not win. We made AI play against itself and even AI loses against AI. Number of norminette errors: 720. Next time you should do more!"
"aapenko","amazing work! Great job! Explained everything very well!"
"aapenko","nicely done, works smoothly, errors handled well, explained their code to me, good luck!"
"aapenko","Outstandingly smooth. Very nice. Thumbs up."
"aapenko","Worked through it like a pro. We discussed the problems and solutions, the exercises were done well and it seemed like he really understands what he's doing. Good job and good luck with your next projects :)"
"aapenko","Quick and perfect!"
"aapenko","nice chat with Artem, nicely done !! See you man!!"
"aapenko","so sorry (fd leak from map reading)
 heres a croissant recipe for your trouble:
 The Process
 make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk
 roll out dough into a large rectangle
 make the butter layer (I have an easy trick for this!!!)
 enclose the butter layer inside the dough
 roll out the dough into another large rectangle, then fold it back together
 roll out the dough again, fold it back together again
 roll out the dough one more time, fold it back together
 shape the croissants
 bake"
"aapenko","Really great understanding and great chat. I learned about stuff I am doing that are not necessary. It is a pleasure to evaluate you every time :)"
"aapenko","Well done, everything seems to be working properly, showed a deep level of knowledge of the subject. Only the ex03 is missing. "
"aapenko","good job on the project, everything works well, thanks for explaining everything! Kudos!"
"aapenko","We went through the whole subject and all the exercises and discussed concepts of class inheritence, which is new in C++ (compared to C). All the things asked in the evaluation sheet work fine and Artem explained everything i couldnt understand to me perfectly fine.
 Thanks for the explainations! : )"
"aapenko","Explained eveything in detail, well structured code, in ex01: in the int/float constructor was no special message but functionality is fine and in subject only says ""something similiar to that"" so its fine for me, well done!"
"aapenko","Explained all well, was fun looking at c++ and how it works!"
"aapenko","The code looks clean and well written, he was able to explain all his code and why and how he implemented things. Everything worked well and he walked me through his code - thank you very much for that! Great work!"
"aapenko","Great work, couldn't find any errors. everything worked fine. good luck"
"aapenko","Everything checked out, didn't expect Artem to have any kinda troubles with that :) have fun!"
"aapenko","All of the exercises worked and you were able to explain all of the code. Good job and good luck :)"
"aapenko","Looks good, they even made versions in 2 different programming languages."
"aapenko","Very good implementation of the game, even in two languages. I really like it! Just for you to know: Josh Wardle, ein in New York City lebender Brite, entwickelte das Spiel zunächst für seine Lebensgefährtin und ließ es später auch weitere Familienmitglieder spielen; im Oktober 2021 veröffentlichte er es im Internet. Der Name des Spiels ist ein Wortspiel aus dem Nachnamen seines Erfinders Josh Wardle."
"aapenko","Very nice minishell, thank you for showing me edge cases even though it destroyed my mental health even further
 The Process
 make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk
 roll out dough into a large rectangle
 make the butter layer (I have an easy trick for this!!!)
 enclose the butter layer inside the dough

 they wer quite firendly explained everything."
"aapenko","Artem and Paul explained their code very well. We even discussed some very tough edge cases. Good luck for the other evals!"
"aapenko","Thanks for showing the code. The programm is really fast and i could not find any errors. He thousht about many edge cases! Good luck for the next projects :)"
"aapenko","We had a great conversation about the project and coding in general, tried different tests , inputs and the philo program works as expected, no mem leaks, no data races..Perfect..Mistake from previous time was corrected !!"
"aapenko","The Code looks very clean, great job and good luck with your next evaluations."
"aapenko","The code is clear, everything works in the best way. The performance of the code is really good, for easy file 0.138s, for medium file 0.622s and for hard one 0.914s, wow!. Guys have done really great job on thid project, keep it up!"
"aapenko","Ye, very good job, try to obfuscate the code for the favore of the norminette even more, i still can read it!"
"aapenko","good job. unfortunately with 1 philo had some problems. otherwise good job!"
"aapenko","Got very well introduced into the project, it matches the requirements and has its unique texture details. Keep up the grind!"
"aapenko","Really enjoyed playing the game, great coding as always and learned a lot - thank you :)"
"aapenko","Everything works well and Artem was able to explain it to me perfectly. Well done!"
"aapenko","Very clean code, understands everything. Also great explanations. Well done"
"aapenko","Thank you for showing me you project and explained it very well :) your code looks very clean. Good luck"
"aapenko","Very good explaination. Ipressive handshake idea. Very pleasant evaluation session. As always he knows his stuff. Thanks"
"aapenko","Nice Programm. Good explanations and also giving nice explantion about exit command. Thanks"
"aapenko","The server unfortunately was not able to print a very long string without corrupting the stream."
"aapenko","very nice explanation and an intimate understanding of your code. Well done!"
"aapenko","Good explanation of the code. We tested everythink and it worked. Good work. Keep it up."
"aapenko","Code nicely written, I dont think I could come up with a situation to make the project fail. Good job :) "
"aapenko","Well done, the code looks good and seems to work as intended."
"aapenko","Very impressive as usual :-) Great job!!"
"aapenko","Good job everything seems to work, thanks for explaining everything about the project! Good luck!"
"aapenko",";^) Artem knows the truth"
"aapenko","In case ./push_swap ""  1 2 "" has double free :( I am sure you will manage it soon, good luck with it!"
"aapenko","ft_split could cause segfault  as a wrong pointer is checked in put_word function. Otherwise the program passes the tests successfully so good luck with the next Submission! "
"aapenko","The progrom does not handle input number with double qoutes, sorry."
"aapenko","Well done project, the student explained me everything in details. Well done!"
"aapenko","Great work. I am amazed by his work. This is incredible. He explained everything that I asked him. I am waiting to be freed! Good luck!"
"aapenko","all good. everything working. "
"aapenko","clean code, tested all types, good explainations, good test functions gl"
"aapenko","Logically, there is no problem, and all corner issues are handled!
 However, the function independancy and the variables and the overall readability will be suggested to be adjusted again."
"aapenko","very good coding work and he explained everything very well"
"aapenko","ну, круто"
"aapenko","Thank you for all the explanations, I like the implementation! Good Luck!"
"aapenko","Very good work. Good explanations. Good luck with norminette."
"aapenko","In the get_next_lines_utils.c the ""char	*read_file(int fd)"" does only protect a read at the beginning NOT every read afterwards, if you have a read error after reading in the 2nd Buffer, it will not free() and return NULL it return an incomplete line-str --> unexpected behaviour"
"aapenko","thanks for explaining makefile in such detail, everything else was also nice/good luck!"
"aapenko","Mistakes from the previous submsission in makefile were corrected so not much to be checked here, but we run tests and they are still good to go. Good luck with moulinette"
"aapenko","Great job. Keep doing like this."
"aapenko","Im so sorry, but libft doesnt compile with flags"
"aapenko","francinette says it's working, i couldn't find errors in the functions francinette disagrees."
"aapenko","Good job, clear understanding, we had a great discussion. Good luck with moulinette!"
"aapenko","looks good to me. great project. Good look for mulinette :-)"
"aapenko","Every test goes very well. Thanks for the explanation and good luck for the bsq! :) "
"aapenko","Thats the real stuff, was a pleasure to be here and see the pros at work. Have fun at the exam."
"aapenko","really nice group and great way to solve the problem. There are some problem with the Makefile - check it again- Also do not forget to write Errors in the error output. There is a tiny mistake with the spaces at the end of the output in cases like 560 and please make your files names more understandable :) But really nice group - good luck for the end of the piscine :)))"
"aapenko","Nice code, good luck ;)"
"aapenko","this looks very good!! thanks for explaining !"
"aapenko","Great Code. He knows his code very good. Keep it up!!!"
"aapenko","too high for me ,but good luck!!"
"aapenko","it looks very good! i learned a lot! :)"
"aapenko","great work hope passes"
"aapenko","Everything looking good, very well explained, clean code. :D"
"aapenko","excellent work"
"aapenko","Code looks okay, well explained make exercise, in the last excercise there is problem with allocation of memory. "
"aapenko","Unfortunately the last program did not allocate enough space. Everything else seemed fine. Good luck fixing the bug."
"aapenko","good job, wtf"
"aapenko","Looks great. Amazing explonation!"
"aapenko","Nice code, good job. Good luck."
"aapenko","ty for walkthrough"
"aapenko","AI in Human form at work!!!"
"aapenko","everything seems fine. good luck with the last two exercises."
"aapenko","Good teamwork and good code, but with some mistakes.
 The allocated memory was not freed and the malloc were not protected in case of failure. Anyway they managed to fix the not freed memory by writing a function during the evaluation.
 Learn how to use valgrind and lldb, they will be very useful. Good luck for the exam. ^_^"
"aapenko","The evaluation was very good, he explained everything =)"
"aapenko","Very impressive!"
"aapenko","Everything looks good to me!"
"aapenko","fantastic work!! sorry can't help very much because i learned a lot from this evaluation ! thanks and good luck!!"

"aapenko","Good job! well explained! keep up)"
"aapenko","explained everything very good and precise. keep up the good work :)"
"aapenko","great explaintation of his code, this guy knows his stuff"
"aapenko","nice work :)
 sadly failed on checking for 0 and negative numbers for y
 also max INT didnt work

 talked a bit about how to avoid these things in the future, explained argc, argv, and talked about the write function :))

 gl with next exam and rush <3"
"aapenko","everything was perfect. great teacher !:) thank you."
"aapenko","Impressive work, goodluck !"
"aapenko","Nice explanation about every exercise. Keep going you are doing amazing. :D"

"aapenko","It was real relaxed session. Thanks for all the explanations. I am actually surprised that I get it. Good luck. "
"aapenko","Awesome job and impressive skills, a small mistake with the return in ex04."
"aapenko","Intresting solutions. minor mistakes need to be fixed in ex02 & ex04"
"aapenko","Maschine. He came soooooo far. he done it but changed at he last sec "
"aapenko","nice project, great explanations :)"
"aapenko","Great job dude!:)"
"aapenko","Artem is obviously very talented and capable at explaining his code to me, who has no experience, very friendly and easy to understand."
"aapenko","Very cool guy! "
"aapenko","Great job"
"aapenko","great job, everything works! explained a lot about the solutions!! "
"aapenko","Good work. Thanks for the spoilers!"
"aapenko","I'm impressed, great job :-)"
"aapenko","could answer all implementation details with excellence, great, friendly and open defense round"
"aapenko","great "
"aapenko","Everything was good."
"aapenko","perfect explantion and very cool guy"
"aapenko","looks good"
"aapenko","very nice, explained everything awesome +*"
"aapenko","next time dont forget to git push :)"
"aapenko","empty work"
"aapenko","great job"
"aapenko","All up to date. He is knowledgable about each exercise and knows how to reproduce each one as well."
"aapenko","First was wring so evaluation stopped"
"aapenko","minor mistake in the first exercies, but everything else worked fine"
"aapenko","More files than requested were included. Otherwise great work!"
"aapenko","Went great"
"aapostol","Great job! Everything well explained and I ve learned a lot for my next Projects!
 Good luck for the next evals!!!! "
"aapostol","Took the time to answer all my questions. Was a great eval. I think a already understood some of C++.
 I gave Outstanding, because she explained everything very well and made it also easy for me to follow her explanations.
 Good luck."
"aapostol","Fixed the minor detail that was wrong the last time, all other things remain unchanged and work just as well as they did before. gg, gl"
"aapostol","Very nice project, could explain everything very well :)"
"aapostol","Technical aspects all worked perfectly fine, there was just an optical flaw (imo) with how the member attributes of the Contact class were implemented. No biggie"
"aapostol","I loved the evaluation and I can even do one question from practice (she is goood...!)"
"aapostol","Talked loads about theory, i asked questions that were answered thoroughly and correctly. Also the levels were played. You explained it really well for someone who didnt do the project yet! "
"aapostol","we did the tests together! everything went smooothly. Afterwards she gave a intruduction into ips and stuff. Well explantion, was able to answer all my question and gave a a lot of knowledge keep it up!"
"aapostol","works fine, explained it very clear and easy to understand aswell, only unfortunate problem is that in level 3 we encountered a problem which we couldn't explain, since everything was fine at first.  "
"aapostol","great job! thank you for taking your time and explaining networking and subnetting in detail to me. I ll have to submit this project in the next few weeks to so you helped me out a great lot! Impressive 5 minutes - you rushed it! :D Good luck :)"
"aapostol","The levels were done under 10min. Very good job, she explained me her logic and everything made sense. Thank you. "
"aapostol","great project, the code looks great, they have the best sprites."
"aapostol","Great work, good project and explanation, code is readable and understandable. 0 leaks, keep it up!"
"aapostol","Everything worked as tested, passed all the map checks, mini map looks cool! good luck!"
"aapostol","Looks Nice. The header of the game is nicely made, also I like the overall formatting of the game itself.
 Would have been cool if the format is responsive, so that too small terminals do not mess with the design.

 Anyways the coloring of the words looks good. I also like the cool feature of CTRL+D they implemented."
"aapostol","Well implemented wordle game, I really like it. The game is really colorful and playable. The number of norm errors is impresive as well, 69 for only 10 files:) The only small issue, that screen is not cleaned after wrong word (longer, shorter or non existing one), but otherwise outstanding game! Keep it up! GL with next rush!"
"aapostol","great work! Unfortunately there are some issues:
 - error messages are not formatted according to the subject, somewhere it does not even announce that error happened, just reason. (for argc !=2 there is no message at all)
 - map parsing does not work in case like that:
 1111111
 1000111                                                 1000111
 1100001                                                 110N001
 1111111                                                 1111111
 * here 0s are not surrounded by 1s -> segfault when you try to walk out of it.
 In the bonus part, can go through structs if you go through the exact corner like this:
 10
 01
 Good luck with the next submission, i believe it will be succesful:)"
"aapostol","good and thoroughly explained the code I test every possible cases that I knew everything worked perfect. good luck for your further projects."
"aapostol","Very nice code. Were able to explain every part and how the fixed there problems. Good job. Keep Going. ^-^"
"aapostol","Had a nice chat , discussed the project in detail. Tested a lot of edge cases, i can see there was a lot of time invested in this minishell. They created also a lot of own tests. Checked with valgrind also different edge cases. Well done . Good luck!!"
"aapostol","good work , but they have a problem with with only spaces , export""Ee=10"" , ehab=10 and echo$ """" and ''. good Luck"
"aapostol","Very nice and clean Code. She was able to explain everything in detail and I had the feeling she really understood what the philosophers problem is and how to ""solve"" it with our allowed functions!
 Nicely done good job!"
"aapostol","This was a very well written project, I learned some interesting things about how to optimize the code better. I especially liked the error handling and how the timestamps are printed always in an orderly manner. Checked a lot of cases and both valgrind and helgrind were clean. Even done ulimit checks with both -v and -u and saw nothing out of the ordinary. Funcheck also seemed clean. Well done!"
"aapostol","Nice chat with Ada about the project, works properly tested a lot of cases, there are no data races or memory leaks. Great!!"
"aapostol","Really great project. Code is clean and was well explained. Unfortunately there was an unlock of a not locked mutex shown in helgrind, when there is just 1 philo. Should be fixed with just one line of code.

 Otherwise cool project and good luck!"
"aapostol","worked well. tested with valgrind and helgrind and several inputs... prev errors were fixed"
"aapostol","good work, NO LEAK, NO CRASHES. She explained the Topic very good and has deep understanding. Keep up the good work and good luck with minishell. "
"aapostol","Sadly, with 3 800 200 200 one philosopher dies because he can't eat. Also the starting time is different for every philosopher, but I am not sure if that is a mistake or not. Except for that her code is very clean and she protected everything very very well!"
"aapostol","Great job. I liked her implementation of her philo program. Philos were eating properly, the death message was printed correctly. Overall her program worked as expected. Unfortunatelly we found some problems with the error handling: She didn't destroy all mutexes and some values aren't correctly inited, thus resulting in unconditional jump and double free issues. "
"aapostol","Thanks for showing me the project and showing me how you did it. Amazing how you trick me  with the static var and by freeing/exiting directly from the libft functions. I thought i would have had you :) but everything fine and really well explained. Great job!!!! congrats :)"
"aapostol","Good job! Very eloquent explanations and cool flowchart :) good luck with your next eval and coming projects!!"
"aapostol","well executed project, code is clean and easy to understand, even provided a well designed flow chart that shows the order of execution. good job, keep it up"
"aapostol","Everything looked very nice and it worked fine. Only when I aborted the client while sending and then sent another message from a new client it got messed up. The storage char and the bitcount have not been reset here, this is what could lead to garbage value in the string. :("
"aapostol","Very good Job, she could explain everything it good and was able to answer all my questions. We tested it and also tested it of LEAKS- NO LEAKS. It handled also big sizes of text. Keep up the good work and good luck with push_swap."
"aapostol","I was a bit scared coming here not knowing if you have updated your code according to the new info on discord (Thanks Elidjah) but you did! It was really clean and readable, and liked the solutions that made the user experience more comfortable. (Like the cute messages and printing the text on the clients side - comes in handy when dealing with long texts and you don't know what's happening in the background.) Well done and keep it up!"
"aapostol","She explained her code thoroghly and she showed me how test the code erverything worked fine . good luck with your further projects."
"aapostol","nice game. I enjoyed playing it and it was amazing to try to destroy her code but she handled all leaks as far as I could say."
"aapostol","Very simple design, but works perfectly! Checked with invalid maps etc., no leaks to be found. Good job :) "
"aapostol","good work :)"
"aapostol","Great project - we spoke about my own get next line actually because i should need some stuff. Code is clear and everything work as it should"
"aapostol","Easy eval since she just had to fix the header name for the bonus part :) Code looks nice and works perfectly! Good job "
"aapostol","very nice work. tested with everything in the sheet and ran the test scripts. Everything works. I noticed only one thing. The header of the bonus in the c file is not explicitly the bonus header. Still worked though so I will not count it as an error. the norm was also respected"
"aapostol","Nothing much to be said here - everything works just fine as far as I'm concerned! Don't think I would've done it any different (I didn't lol), your code is readable, as such... full marks from me! Hope you'll have fun with the next project, take care and keep on coding!"
"aapostol","Very nice evaluation. She has a clean code and was able to explain it properly. Nice work. GL with mouli. :)"

"aapostol","good girl "
"aapostol","Thanks for showing me your virtual machine. She has put quiet some effort into it. She was able to explain me everything with detail. Also her bash script was perfectly formatted. She even started bleeding during the evaluation from her ear, but it did not stop her from answering all my detailed questions. Good job!"

"aapostol","Finished all the functions and they all work as intended, nicely done."
"aapostol","Great job! we ran through franciss script and everything checked out. She also explained what she did. Good luck for the exam!
 Also, did you know: Flamingoes are only pink because of chemicals called carotenoids in the algae and fish (which also eat the algae) they eat; their feathers are grayish white when they're born. "
"aapostol","Looks good, everything worked. Hopefully no timeout :S"

"abektimi","Great project, everything was explained very well, thank you, good luck"
"abektimi","Very good project! Couldnt find any leaks, crashes, etc. Everything was working as its written in the eval sheet and the explanations were on point! Good luck!"
"abektimi","Good work, no leaks, no errors found, I enjoyed evaluating this project and got a glimpse into cub3d!"
"abektimi","Unfortunately as stated to me few days ago in the email warning as ""Concerning Situation"" on cub3d evaluation, we are not allowed to use any other version of mlx apart from one installed on our computer. That's why i had to fail this project. Apart from that i went through all edge cases that i could think of and everything looks fine except some case of new lines after the map. Good luck."

 pls help me to finish mine! :')  "
"abektimi","The Shell works as smooth as it can be, i really enjoyed playing with it and listening to the thorough explanations from the boys. Really proud to see all of their hard work coming to life. Great evaluation and i wish the next evaluator as much fun as i had with it."
"abektimi","today on this fathomable evening i had the great pleasure to evaluate Mr. Mburgler and Mr. ABektimirov on there Minishell. the minishell was doing its work quite well and we went through the evaluation sheet in detail. in Conclusion, great work brotheren may thy minishell pass. good luck on future works. with lovely regards your pookiebear."

"abektimi","very nice project! i enjoyed that he implemented pacman sprites and i think it could be developped even further ;) He didn't have any memory leaks or norminette errors and his code is clear."
"abektimi","great code and even greater explanation! loved the game, brought back memories. good job and good luck!"
"abektimi","Wow this shit is fire. He used quicksort, linked list and all the stuff I was too stupid or too mentally stable for. Great work, master"
"abektimi","hallo das ist die evaluation von alex das projekt von ihm namens push die swaps war sehr gut nachdem es die swaps gepusht hat und die pushes geswaped  scha po mister alex. apropo hast du gewusst das am 14. april 2023 der chinisische president einen grüntee trinken wird der war sicher ganz lecker auch werde ich am 1 mai geburtstag haben und da wird nichts besonderes passieren, auch natürlich nichts geheimnissvolles oder fragwürdiges wiee gesagt PUSH swap SWAP push"
"abektimi","Really nice implementation, well done. I learned a lot since I didn't find time to do the project myself yet! Thank you :)"
"abektimi","Nice project! Everything works! Even If I Did not make the project yet, I understood it! Very good explanation! "
"abektimi","Very Well done. Super good explaination"
"abektimi","Fixed the leak issues from the prev. submission. norminette ran without complaint. Makefile did what it should. Tested with short, long  and unicode strings. Everything worked as stated in the subject; second time seems to be the charm. "
"abektimi","Sadly found memory leak in client. But Alex knows his code very good and explained me a lot. We did some test together and everything work like it should work. After valgrind  check Alex rewrite his code that there is no memory more. So good luck next time! And remember to check malloc's and free's next time.  "
"abektimi","looks like a really good project. it compiled without error, norminette didn't complain either, i tested it with really long messages and with unicode symbols, everything worked very well. Even when I had several youtube videos in the background. Unfortunately you forgot to free your allocated array. Once you fix that it will be perfect."
"abektimi","Code works nicely; it's fast and the unicode compatibility is there, but he forgot to free a dynamically allocated string so I gotta flag it"
"abektimi","Very talented boy. Explained everything really well even tho I did not really understand all of it. stabil"
"abektimi","he's new to sysadmin but everything is as specified and in order, he was friendly and patient enough to go over everything. he had some trouble remembering certain commands but managed anyhow, good job."
"abektimi","We did all the steps required in the evaluation. Everything worked and he could answer the questions.   The partitions were set up like in the subject pdf and he downloaded cockpit for the free choice bonus and explained how it works. I googled it to verify as I didn't know about this before. All in all very nice work"
"abektimi","Thank you. He was able to explain everything and his code was running smoothly."
"abektimi","Very nice work, fixed the error from last submission, now included a default buffer size, I was already familiar with the code as I was also an evaluator for his last submission so the evaluation was very quick.  "
"abektimi","Nice code! Peer knows his code very very good! Fixed mistake from previous submission but didn't do the bonus) here is some interesting stuff: The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military. The Enigma machine was considered so secure that it was used to encipher the most top-secret messages."
"abektimi","The brother is nice but he fogot about the constant variable. L"
"abektimi","Very nice code. everything looks good concerning the code itself no memory leaks or similar. He only forgot to add a default buffer size in his header file. therefore we encountered a compiler error when manually compiling. the test scripts didn't pick this up. norminette was also happy."
"abektimi","good guy, sadly it does not compile without the -D flags, so D:
 other than that it seemed pretty gooded"
"abektimi","Explained everything nicely. Good luck with the other projects"
"abektimi","I like trains. Watch the movie Rheingold + the code was good and he explained it very well for like 7 minutes straight "
"abektimi","Very nice work, good idea to put every function in a seperate file, makes everything very clean, code looks very well written, makefile does what it is supposed to do, could explain his thought process very well, very hard guy. Test script and my own tests didn't throw any errors"
"abektimi","It was a sunny day when I found out I had to evaluate Mr Alexander.I'm drinking a coffee right now in the room without having vocals here so I don't get community service.(of course this is just a joke) All in all I liked the presentation I mean it's not a presentation it's a project but you know what I mean. with love Adam"
"abektimi","Very good. explained it to me in detail. My testscript showed two KO but he was able to explain in the evaluation why it is still correct. Keep up the good work. :)"
"abektimi","He explained everything very carefully and thorough. Very hard guy!"
"abektimi","очень хороший проект, отлично сделано, и он действительно знает свое дело!"
"abektimi","er will. er will wirklich!"

"abied-ch","That's a really good job for a 2 days rush, the team worked in a well way on this project, every member know well their part, the explains were also good :) Good job!

 I don't have that much to say, good that you haven't hardcoded anything for the images, you are able to display every types of images that are hidden in the files, nice! Only thing that I could say is that you shouldn't use flags in your Makefile that will alterate your code like debug flag which will add dummy symbols or optimisation flags that might change some behaviour in your code (by example replacing your functions)

 Have a nice day!"
"abied-ch","Really cool project! I think coolest solution for this rush, very professional looking, you got all the colors right & display all images, really impressive. Thanks for explanation."
"abied-ch","He is explaning the code very well, It was a good introduction for me. I hope soon I will there as well. "
"abied-ch","thanks for explaining, even with my knowlege of cpp, its ""0"", i understood a lot, thank you and good luck!"
"abied-ch","Thank you a lot for lifting my mood! That is really kind of you to give your points to the ones that need it. Thank you one more time! Good luck on your projects;)"
"abied-ch","For some reason he put inside a video that can offend everyone.
 such a bad person, should be kicked 100% for it. Can't see him anymore around"
"abied-ch","Unfortnatly there was a wrong file in the repo. "
"abied-ch","ufortunately empty repo, :((( wish you good luck "
"abied-ch","Sadly did forget to push :( we still looked at the not pushed stuff and found some error: exceptions need to be thrown and then not catched immediatly - else you don't have an exception ;) constructos can also throw - make use of that. Also implementation of form execute with base functionality which can be called by children as AForm::execute is a nice to have! Good luck next time :D"
"abied-ch","Well done as always. Pretty clean and well structured code and also I liked ur file management. GL on exam!"
"abied-ch","Everything seems fine, standard was kept, he explained everything thoroughly and even had his own test script prepared for the eval. Pretty impressed. Good job :)"
"abied-ch","Well protected BTC exchanger, all the edge cases are covered. Only a couple of minor mistakes: \n for merge-insertion sort checker for empty args is missing. \n for RPN multiplication of negative numbers doesnt work. \n Overall, well done! The cleanest Ford-Jonson implementation i have ever seen. Keep it up!!!"
"abied-ch","Well done, btc checker is really solid and algo from ex02 is well implemented, just a minor mistake in ex01. Good luck with it, should be an east fix!"

"abied-ch","Everything works, except a small mistake in ex00. Gl with next modules!"
"abied-ch","Very nice code, thanks for explaining me how it works, i'm always lost when it comes to CPP but i think slowly i get it better. Everything seems to work according to eval sheet, except sometimes Bureaucrats with a wrong grade can be created, but i hope it will still pass!"
"abied-ch","Excellent work man! thanks a lot for explaining every step, function and aspect of C++
 Good luck with the other project, ans see you around for a coffee.

"abied-ch","Great explanation. He knows his stuff and answered my question. Always polite and a good coder thanks a lot. Btw this is the last test: The program harlFilter takes as argument any of the log levels (""DEBUG"",
 ""INFO"", ""WARNING"" or ""ERROR""). It should then display just the messages
 that are at the same level or above (DEBUG < INFO < WARNING < ERROR)."

The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. You could fit 109 Earths side by side to match the diameter of the Sun, and it would take 1.3 million planets the size of the Earth to fill it up, crazy right?"
"abied-ch","We found one issue together, when (ulimit -n 6; ./minishell) then MAkefile | cat | ... | cat  > out
 will print cat cammand not found and escape the minishell.
 In my optinion I think both escape the minishell can be one of the error handling but with wrong command message I thought it means when some unexcept issue happen but not handle.
 Good luck!!"

"abied-ch","Great explanations, thanks a lot! Outstanding for using malloc - and asking if you should :-p Everything works, we tested it."
"abied-ch","Everything works perfectly well."
"abied-ch","leider data race, you have to check if the philo is finisch and put the tow forks and then to continue, test with valgind --tool=helgrind"" and ""--tool=drd
 sorry  "
"abied-ch","Great explanation. The code was tested and it works. Good job and keep it up :)"
"abied-ch","Great job, everything checks out, keep on keepin' on!"

"abied-ch","A forbidden function was used, he knew it beforehand. What a shame since the rest of the project looks really cool and everything works fine! Great job nonetheless!"
"abied-ch","unfortunately he used forbidden functions "
"abied-ch","Thanks for the explanations :) learned a lot"
"abied-ch","very good and detailed explanations of the code. all tests worked as they should. very pleasant and informative evaluation"
"abied-ch","Code looks great and clean! Very well explained and has lots of knowledge about the project! Well done and good luck! :)"
"abied-ch","Arthur already knew that he has an error handling problem in his implementation and knows how to fix it.
 He walked me through his code and the piping works nicely. Thanks for explaining the project to me!
 Good luck with the next try!"
"abied-ch","Program still doing some stuff after throwing an error and modified output file when shouldn't"
"abied-ch","Tried to explain me as much as I could understand. Good job, we go through codes. All the best"
"abied-ch","Great work, i tried my best to find some errors but failed to do so. The peer demonstrated clean view on the topic and explained everything required. The memory issues were not present and crashes were not possible. Great work to witness, good job, fellow."
"abied-ch","Great code, well explained, I almost understood))
 Good luck )"
"abied-ch","Great work. Seems to have understood the problem and can explain his code. Keep up the good work"
"abied-ch","Unfortunately the program does segfault (ft_split and ft_lstnew is not protected).
 Also maybe improve the overflow checking."
"abied-ch","Really cool implementation. Very detailed and comprehensive explanation. No leaks or weird cases found. Cool guy. Good luck with the rest of the evaluations!"
"abied-ch","Explained everything incredibly well, definitely coming back for tips when I do this project. Nice work:)"

"abied-ch","try again"
"abied-ch","ft in ex06 is written wrong, other wise good job!"
"abied-ch","ex 04 it should be prototyped as void	ft_is_negative(int n) , otherwise the function works . "
"abied-ch","Well done, Mister!!!"
"abied-ch","He is the King!!"
"abied-ch","Almost, o is missing. nice to meet you. See you at the next partyboy event"

 ex04: remove folder path
 ex05: use the correct command"
"aguilmea","Very interesting evaluation:) Didnt know anything about docker so far, now I know a liitle bit :) Thanks for that! Anni explained very well, it was just very hard to follow because the topic is very complex. GOOD JOB! I am pretty sure that all the things worked .-."
"aguilmea","Well done, explained everything in such a way that even a Docker newbie such as myself could understand everything. Even did one of the bonus parts (simple static page). "
"aguilmea","Excellent project! I really liked how to secured everything (with the certificates, the docker usernamespace remp, etc). It's very clear that you enjoyed the project :)

"aguilmea","I'm doing only C++05, so I couldn't check all extreme cases, but Annie explained me everything very deep, showed a lot of own tests. I'm very exited, I've learned a lot. Thank you very much for such great explanation. "
"aguilmea","Great work. Very well explained and we didnt find any issue with the code. Thanks and good lick!"
"aguilmea","Very well explained. Tested everything and explained everything to me! Thanks and good luck! "
"aguilmea","Thank you for taking the time to explain everything in detail, it made a lot more sense than most other evaluators!
 Good luck with the exam, I'll make sure to ask you when I need help with my 09:)"
"aguilmea","Very nice! Everything was understood pretty well.
 Good job!"
"aguilmea","Had a nice chat with Annie as always, the code in all the exercises looks clear and easy to read, there was a small mistake in ex00 with the bitcoin where all the bitcoin prizes over 1000 were not accepted and not imported later in the database and couldnt be used. In the RPN everything worked, i am not sure if double values are the ones that are proper to use but it looks also ok with it. I did it with int. And in the last exercise the algorithm works as expected and the explanations were really good. "
"aguilmea","Great evaluation. We studied many cases and everything worked as it should except some small mistakes in the first excersize. Annie knows her stuff. Thanks for the new information. "

"aguilmea","Nice project, all executrices are correct. She explained me a lot stuff about cpp and have really big knowlage about it. Good luck with Cpp06!"
"aguilmea","Everything seems to be working properly, except the intern part in ex03. The problem is in for loop, because in increments i two times. Therefore, interns were not created. Apart from that, very well done! Good luck :)"
"aguilmea","Great explanations, and it's really sad that the project needs to be failed because of just one small mistake. Courage!"
"aguilmea","Good Job! Was very fast and able to explain everything! Keep Going ^^"

"aguilmea","Really well implemented, thank you for walking me through the whole project and taking your time to explain the concepts and the workings of CPP to me. All the tests were passed without any problem. Great work!"
"aguilmea","Thank for the explanation I really learnt a lot.
 And maybe you could try coding style formatter ´black´ when leaning a new language."
"aguilmea","great evaluatution. forgot to delete prototype from class declaration but everything still works and she could explain it all :)"
"aguilmea","explained everything she did, especially helped me know the concept reference, checked all code, unfortunately ex02 has problems in main, good luck for the next try. "
"aguilmea","We discussed everything in great details especially the 01 exerscise. Everything works as expected, but unfortunately ex 02 did not compile and ex03 was not done. Good luck with next eval!"
"aguilmea","Interesting project. Everything works as expected. Good job"
"aguilmea","Great work. Was a lot of information due to the reason I'm not so used to CPP.
 We checked her work through all the testcases. Looks really god - great work!"
"aguilmea","The explanations were excellent, with all the big concepts explained and all the details underlined. It was a pleasure. The code works great, we made all the tests. Courage pour les exceptions!"

"aguilmea","That was a detailed evaluation, nice! Very different approach to many things, but also super cool to see something new. Worked like a charm, no leaks, no deadlocks whatsoever. Thanks for taking the time to explain everything to me, you seemed very confident in what you did there. Good luck with the next and last evaluation and see you next time! (:"
"aguilmea","nice explanations and everything is working! good job! :3"
"aguilmea","Thanks for showing me your project Annie & Chris!! We checked all the commands, we found a discrepancy in the navigating the history after entering empty lines, but after discussing we agreed that it is a feature not a bug :) All the best, gl hf gute nacht"
"aguilmea","Great project! I tried my best to find mistakes but everything worked as expected. Even some extras that were not necessary were implemented. I asked a lot of questions and both of them could answer everything. I learned a lot and am looking forward to writing my own minishell now! Good luck to you guys! Well done!"
"aguilmea","Very nice (super interesting) project. They really put a lot of effort into their project and handled a lot of extra special cases. Really hope this try works out! :) Great teamwork "
"aguilmea","Unfortunately had an invalid read when giving """" as an argument. So sooooorryyyy for that!!!
 But you two got this, next time will work out!!
 Otherwise serious great work, handled very nice extra stuff and explained me the code quite detailed. Thank you for the ""learning session""!
 Good luck for the next time :D"
"aguilmea","I am really impressed about their work. Their Minishell runs pretty great however we found a little error with redirection on an existing file. The content is not deleted and is still showing. But after all a great project. Keep up! "

"aguilmea","Very interesting, flawlessly working minishell! Had a lot of fun, enjoyment and pleasure! Keep it up guys! :)"
"aguilmea","The code looks good. A lot of effort is spent in implementing various functions. But unfortunately in crashed. "
"aguilmea","Really good minishell, the general explains of the structure of the code were really good
 the work have been splited correctly, there is some little problems that will be for sure fixed for the next push:
 - export variable= -> should be in your env
 - unset 123variable -> error + returning 1
 - Syntax error, wrong return values, should be 2
 - expand problem : export test=""s -la"" -> l$test
 - leaks in case of an incorrect command, same with . and ..
 - mkdir -p a/b/c/d cd a/b/c/d rm -rf ../../../../a -> the minishell exit, you should take a lot into that
 - the signals inside child process, don't forget to ignore the signals of the parent and reactivate them in the child
 - echo: echo ""$PWD""$PATH, not working, looks like it's concatenating the 2 variables and it's not finding any of them after that
 - Maybe a problem with your prompt sometimes when doing echo -n, it's going back inside the prompt
 Good luck for fixing all this and for your next projects! That was a good evaluation"
"aguilmea","Memory leaks with export, unset, $HOME and """". Launch Minishell  in MInishell ctrl-c dit not work. Heredoc did not work with pipes."
"aguilmea","Very good project / Really good understanding of the Codebase / Happy Coding :)"

"aguilmea","PERFECT!"
"aguilmea","It was a very nice eval, Annie! :) I learned a lot. You tried different approaches and find the really efficient way. Also with the bonus. The program passed all the tests we did. It is also very efficient and quite impressive! Well done and wishing you all the best for the other projects! "
"aguilmea","I am still mindblown by your algorithm! Crazy benchmarks and very impressive implementation. We discussed some details, argued about some inputs but all in all it was a very rewarding evaluation! <3"

"aguilmea","Good job!"
"aguilmea","have fun revisiting libft. good luck :)"

"aguilmea","Really good implemantation of Quicksort Algorithm. Performs very well on all testet ranges. Segfault if run without args. Should be a quick fix and gonna be 100p afterwords. Do the bonus :)"
"aguilmea","Everything worked as it should. Also learned very much for my own born2beroot  in the future! "
"aguilmea","we went through all the points in the evaluation. She remembered all the commands without having to think about it. she even showed me a new way to improve the sudo config and have less hassle when updating. "
"aguilmea","You clearly put in a lot of work in this project. Sadly you could not explain differences of OPS very well and were shaky with your explanations. Please read up on the topics we discussed again and i am sure you gonna pass the next time without problems. It is a difficult Project with loads of new information to keep in mind. Stay strong!"
"aguilmea","Well done, good job! Passed all my tests. No memory leaks. Good explanations! Wish you good luck with Moulinette! :)"

"aszabo","In Headerfile incorrect include usage for the libft!. Apart from that, the return value for an error occurring in the original printf should be '-1'. You could also add like conditions for single '%' as the format, as well as a '%' at the end of a format and if there is a '%' and none of the specified variables after that. The rest works how it should, just minor errors and oversights. Keep up, you will do it the next time, I sure :3"
"aszabo","Very nice work! I can see that he has put a lot of effort into his libft and also fixed all the issues from the first attempt. Francinette checked everything and didnt complain either. We looked at the makefile and header file as well as a few functions in detail and discussed the code. All looks good. Good luck! :)"
"aszabo","Very nice work! everything explained and fixed the previous errors! with understanding! good luck) "
"aszabo","Great job, everything seems to be fixed, good luck:)"
"aszabo","Generally the code looks good, besides a few minor mistakes.
 Additionally to the previous evaluation we found:
 ft_strchr if c == \0 return pointer to the end of string
 ft_strncmp returns the difference from s1 and s2 as an unsigned char
 ft_strmapi ft_striteri idx should be unsigned int
 ft_split should free on malloc fail and is_sep is not necessary
 Be careful when calculating how many bytes you need to allocate with malloc `sizof(char) * (len + 1)`"
"aszabo","Wrong returning value on function memset
 line 27 return (NULL);

 Wrong returning value on function memmove
 line 41 return (NULL);

 Wrong condition on function strncmp
 line 20 while (i < n && (s1[i] != '\0' || s2[i] != '\0'))

 Unitialised variable in calloc

 itoa doesnt handle 0 value in a proper way

 malloc is  not protected in split for array

 Everything else looks correct for me. Wish you good luck with the project!"

"aszabo","He is very smart and explained everything to me very well.  "
"aszabo","Really good team, everything was well explained, sadly they are few problems with the malloc, they haven't been protected and it could cause a crash

 Don't forget to protect every external fonction that you will use in the future
 Also something that could be good, is to put your error messages in STDERR

 Except that, everything was good! Congrats!
 Good luck for the rest of the piscine "
"aszabo","He understand his code and is able to answer to questions. well done and keep up with the good work :)"

"aszabo","thanks, was nice to test you"
"bamangel","looks perfect, could handle tens of thousands of characters without breaking and no problems with unicode characters either! :3"
"bamangel","Really good minitalk, the global variable was explained and the code looks clean.
 Good luck for further evals :) "
"bamangel","Thank you for your time and the explanation of your code. It seemed fine and worked as its supposed to be. Maybe resetting the pid would have been a nice extra feature. Good luck with the other evaluations and see you around! :)"
"bamangel","Unfortunately if Strjoin fails and returns NULL there is no check made to check that and return/free accordingly, otherwise, the Client sends another newline after the string is send and the server checks for that newline to know when the string is complete, this step makes it impossible to send strings that have newlines in them, just use the null terminator that you have to send anyway. "
"bamangel","Great job, complex code but very well understood. Original solution!"
"bamangel","Outstanding job, all the tests passed! "
"bamangel","Great and in-depth explanations. Francinette passes in normal mode, strict has a few leaks. We found a few cases where it was possible that some leaks occured, but we tried to fix them but checks with funcheck -a didn't improve. The approach is great though and it looks good to me. I hope moulinette will pass and be fine with it."
"bamangel","Very good explanation, everything in Order, looks good good luck."
"bamangel","Good work. Could explain what she did. Good luck!"
"bamangel","Everything was explained perfectly, good luck with next eval!"

"bamangel","great job!!! and wish u good luck :)"
"bamangel","Did a very good job. The code that you wrote looks really complicated but it works. Nice. Good job and keep it up :)"
"bamangel","Code is very cleanly written and well explained. Good job and good luck"
"bamangel","Great, looks like everything is fixed. The necessary edge cases should now be covered and everything else looks good."
"bamangel","Main functions of printf work (cspdixXu%), however the printf does not handle if the format is NULL (additionally may correct on cases where the format consists of only a '%' or ends on one + what happens if there's a none defined character after the '%' sign). Apart from that, organize the .c file for static functions! Only one non-static function per .c file! Lastly you could add a .PHONY to your Makefile, so that no one will bother you for that :3 Keep up the good work ^w^"
"bamangel","The code is clear and well structured. Looks pretty fine, good luck with moulinette!"
"bamangel","Nice code, seems it all works, thanks for explanations!"

"bhielsch","Great job! Everything was clearly explained and the communication was nice!"
"bhielsch","This was an outstanding evaluation. Bene was done with the 3 levels in less than 3 minutes! Amazing. He even explained everything while completing the tasks, he definitely knows his stuff. Thanks for this experience!"
"bhielsch","good job again Bene , you were very fast and solved the 3 levels in a proper way, thank you for the explanation. looks interesting to me. but i am still far behind .."
"bhielsch","very nice project; but i am bit dissapointed because he didn't do the last one and i know he could have made a great job 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
 I had the pleasure of reviewing Bene's C++ project, and I must say, it was a truly superb piece of work. The project demonstrated a high level of technical proficiency and a deep understanding of C++ programming concepts.
 The code was exceptionally well-structured and easy to read, with a clear separation of concerns and thoughtful use of design patterns. Bene's attention to detail was evident in every line of code, with well-named variables and functions that made the codebase highly maintainable."
"bhielsch","Good job and well execution. Peer could explain everything well !"
"bhielsch","thanks for great explanation. everything works well. main files to test were existing. good job!"
"bhielsch","Big shame about the DiamondTrap's special abilities, other than that everything's done to spec, as far as I can tell. Be extra careful when reading the docs next time around, so you don't miss small details like this one. Still, well done and thanks for all the explanations on C++ and your code :)"
"bhielsch","sorry :(
 good luck by next try "
"bhielsch","From Module 02 to Module 08, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox
 Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated otherwise. Again a problem with the reading comprehension :(  code looks fine though :)"
"bhielsch","Good Job as always Bene..but we found a simple mistake , so all green except the last one !! Nice chat as always!!"
"bhielsch","sadly bene cannot read properly, i think schools in Germany are not that good, especially in Bavaria :( ... points on the edge should be counted as outside the triangle, pdf second to last line!

 rest very well done :)) "
"bhielsch","sadly leaking, he found the mistake himself during the eval though :) "
"bhielsch","great work, peer could explain it very well. unfortunately he found himself some leaks, as he used new() several times which created new Objects and caused leaks. he fixed it and now it does not have leaks.  thanks for explaining!"
"bhielsch","Thanks for explaining in an understanable manner. Great work. He made the chec ks that i thought about. Looks really easy when someone like him explains but I am sure i will have more problems. For sure i took a lot of insides also  for C. Thanks :)"
"bhielsch","well done; especially liked the enum in ex06, who taught you that? ... oh wait it was me :D "

"bhielsch","Very nice code, well explained. Next time be careful with naming bonus files correctly and coding your ft_atoi exactly like original atoi. Good luck with Moulinette!"
"bhielsch","very good work! Lovely guy :) didnt know he was chill like that..."
"bhielsch","Very nice work :) My test say it's working, let's say what Moulinette says :)))"
"bhielsch","I like your work, big shame about those three functions - at least one of them is most likely gonna fail Moulinette's check. Don't fret, you'll make it yet, now you know the errors :) Better luck next time!"

 Also everything works as intended!
 Thank you very much for the patience :)   "
"chasling","Very nice. Explanations were good and everything worked. The tricky ex01, which most people fail were discussed. It was a pleasant evaluation. Thanks"
"chasling","Thanks for the good explanation! I really understood what he was talking about and how the project is supposed to work. Minor thing: the ex01 did not work with the provided files due to ambiguous iter() definitions. However, eval continued as it did not say to stop at that point. Great work! He really understood it."
"chasling","Very nice project, thank you for explaining the concepts to me and walking me through, I learned a lot. "
"chasling","Tests showed fullfilled the requirements, clear explanations are worth mentioning, thx!"

"chasling","Good and nice code. He explain everything well!  Talking to your dog might not be crazy after all. Dogs are highly intelligent and can learn some English. Dogs can learn up to 165 words, particularly words with the hard “t” or “r.” This might explain why all dogs recognize the word “treat.”"
"chasling","Great work, great explanations. Good luck!"

"chasling","Really good minishell, the general explains of the structure of the code were really good
 the work have been splited correctly, there is some little problems that will be for sure fixed for the next push:
 - export variable= -> should be in your env
 - unset 123variable -> error + returning 1
 - Syntax error, wrong return values, should be 2
 - expand problem : export test=""s -la"" -> l$test
 - leaks in case of an incorrect command, same with . and ..
 - mkdir -p a/b/c/d cd a/b/c/d rm -rf ../../../../a -> the minishell exit, you should take a lot into that
 - the signals inside child process, don't forget to ignore the signals of the parent and reactivate them in the child
 - echo: echo ""$PWD""$PATH, not working, looks like it's concatenating the 2 variables and it's not finding any of them after that
 - Maybe a problem with your prompt sometimes when doing echo -n, it's going back inside the prompt
 Good luck for fixing all this and for your next projects! That was a good evaluation"
"chasling","Memory leaks with export, unset, $HOME and """". Launch Minishell  in MInishell ctrl-c dit not work. Heredoc did not work with pipes."

 "
"dcingoz","Excellent project and code. Very funny the naming of the checker function.
 It was nice to test aall the cases, and your code is veryy strong, you passs 100% od the norml tester, and 85% the hardcore one. good job.
 Here  leave you some things we see together and needs to be checked/improved:
 - ft_aoi: check for overflow before doing result = result * 10 + vaal_to_add
 LONG_MAX * 2 + 10
 - Remember to protect: pthread_mutex_init
 If it fails, it returns -1
 - Rememeber to system calls as much as you can.
 - Remeber when destroying mutexes, only initialized mutexes should be destroyed
 (they also should be unlocked)
 - Remember to check if someone died in ft_sleep
 - Check the order of adquisition of the forks.
 Run tthis command: valgrind --tool=helgrind --fair-sched=yes ./philo 4 600 200 200 valgrind --tool=helgrind --fair-sched=yes ./philo 4 600 200 200"
"dcingoz","Great work! I really liked your project. Sadly, there was a unconditional jump ... Otherwise a great project! "
"dcingoz","The code is well structured and really readable. All the edgecases are covered, and all the testes are passed! Well done, keep it up!"
"dcingoz","Very clean code, dont write \0 to output) The explanations and understanding of the mechanism of signals is very nice, learned something new, cuz i did pipex!"

"dcingoz","Good project, we checked every case. It works well, error handling is nice, no leaks. Good job."
"dcingoz","overall great project sadly missused the global variables and defined a struct instead of a single variable. no norm errors. one missing malloc check leading to potentioal segfault."
"dcingoz","sorry for that but norminette does not check the structs in c files. Else the programm is fast. Only errors have to be written on the standard errors. Good luck for fixing thes minor issues."
"dcingoz","When run with multiple non-numeric arguments the program segfaults :(
 Deniz still took the time to explain his approach though despite it failing at my first test!"

"dcingoz","Great work - all 3 pisciners were interested and asked questions even they already know a lot. For the future do not forget to write errors in the error output. You can also mark your functions as static when you will write bigger programs (but you do not have to). Great idea to check the error handling at the beginning of your code. Thanks for your interest and good luck for the next of your piscine!"

"ddyankov","Nice project! It was very interesting to see how it works, learned quite a bit. It has all necessary functionalities implemented. They could answer my questions well and knew their code. Good luck with the last eval!"
"ddyankov","Cool project! Everything works like stated in the subject. We went through the eval sheet and tried to crash it. But the server was resilient. Many clients, even if they go to sleep and come back didn't interrupt the server. Good stuff! I hope everything else works out - good luck!"
"ddyankov","Great Project! Thanks for showing me it in so many details. Really great explanations."
"ddyankov","Project was very well explained and was easy to understand. Congrats and good luck"
"ddyankov","Deyan made an awesome project and had a real love for the details. By far the nicest page i have seen so far at 42. Deyan put a lot of effort into it. And he also showed my how he runs all the stuff. Nice addon with the WP client."
"ddyankov","Thanks A LOT for all the explanations. I learned so much and I am so gratefull. Godd luck with the exam :)"
"ddyankov","Everything seemed fine, I really like your use of macros and colors. Makes it easier to read! =D
 Besides that, I couldn't find any leaks or crashes, code seemed solid and I'm certain you know about your stuff. Good luck with your last evaluation and have fun with the next project after this shitshow (:"
"ddyankov","Looks like a nice CPP_Module! He could explain me what he did and why. I did not find any mistakes in the logic of the Code and the Ford-Johnson sorts the numbers nice :)
 He even checked for / 0 in his RPN and checked his datafile in btc. Nice Work!!"
"ddyankov"," Really good explains, was a good time to evaluate you, everything was fine except some little mistakes in the exercice 00: the separator of your csv is hardcoded, you should to something that would take the caracter of your separator, if you have en empty data.csv, it will produces a segfault, you must check that your map is not empty before doing actions on it (in your checkInputLine), also in your ex02, you could add something to check if it's already sorted to don't do unnecessary actions/operations

 except that everything is fine! Good luck for the repush!"
"ddyankov","nice work, tried his best to explain it to me. everything seemed to work, good luck:)"
"ddyankov","nicely impelmentent and well explained. good job! also lots of colors :)"
"ddyankov","some small mistakes in the last two exercises which are easy to fix, otherwise, seems to be a good work. a typo in ex02, taking value from .end() iterator, not sorted vector in shorspan, in ex02 non-orthodox implementation (although I am not sure if it should be required in this case)"
"ddyankov","The code looks good but there were two mistakes I found:
 in ex01 the shortestSpan() returns the span between the first and the nearest one to it.
 and he did't implement the canonical class form in ex02."
"ddyankov","well done, could explain his code very well <3 "
"ddyankov","very clean understandable code, explained all his exercises, explained backround knowledge, tested all functions - working. Good luck"

"ddyankov","Great execution, most of the bonus was working perfectly. Only the movement of the mouse wasn't smooth. Otherwise a great project!"
"ddyankov","Game looks functional, all tests passed and the previous mistake was corrected. Well done and good luck!"
"ddyankov","The program crashed when empty lines in cubfile. He already has a solution. good luck with next push "

"ddyankov","Good job and good luck with Cub3D :) o7 "
"ddyankov","You can tell that he did his research. The only thing that bothered me was that his assignment operator overloader did not make a deep copy. But since it was not specified that it should make one and he can implement it if he wanted to, it's fine by me. I wish you luck for cubed!"
"ddyankov","Nice implementation! Everything looks good and was perfetctly implemented. Good job!"
"ddyankov","good work, well explained."
"ddyankov","He understood the exercises and could explain everything. Personally, I would have liked it if he didn't use floats for addition and subtraction overloading in ex02. Except for that, everything was good!"
"ddyankov","all ok. checked according to Evaluation sheet. the ex03 (Bsp) was missing."
"ddyankov","good Job."
"ddyankov","good job. he fixed a minor mistake in replace function from previous push. now it works as expected."
"ddyankov","good job! unfortunately the ./replace program got infitnite loop when the searched string was instide the new_string. otherwise all seems OK"
"ddyankov","great project and great explanations. He showed me every detail and checked for errors also when not explicitely asked (name with numbers etc.). Because of the Emojis when calling the constructor of the phonebook he deserves outstanding (just kidding the explanation were outstanding and he took his time to give me advises)"
"ddyankov","Everything works correctly. Very great explanation and deep understanding of the topic. The code is clean and understandable. Thanks a lot for teaching me C++."
"ddyankov","Thank you for explaining how networks and IP addresses work. I think I can do it now! :) "
"ddyankov","very fast. did levels 7,8,9; also explained everything .thanks."
"ddyankov","Explained everything in detail. Also went through every level with me and explained how he configured the networks. Did the levels also really quickly. Thank you very much and good luck!"
"ddyankov","Very nice minishell and polite team. We checked all required commands and everything worked as expected. Good luck!"
"ddyankov","well structured project, though the naming of the variables in the main struct are a bit hard to follow without explanation or documentation. checked with valgrind and ignore file for readline leaks, no memory leaks found during testing. went through the whole evaluation sheet, couldn't find an apparent problem. they could explain their project and the way they approached it very well, they obviously have a good understanding of bash and how it works. good luck for the remaining evaluations."
"ddyankov","everything works, couldn't find any flaws. really outstanding project, they even implemented some Go crazy test inputs. good job!"
"ddyankov","Very good Project. Beautifully written. Sadly a little mistake in heredoc, but they can easily fix it. Good Luck next time. Keep Going!^-^"
"ddyankov","Good minishell, explains were good, there is some little things that have to be improved:

 - Leaks when you have a permission denied during an execution
 - echo return value is not changed except if you make it do a echo $?
 - echo ""$PWD+$PWD""
 - export test=""s -la"" l$test -> command not found
 - CTRL + C -> heredoc
 - Combination with single/doubles quotes produce leaks -> '""""''
 - Export _ is considered as an not a non-valid identifier
 - ls -l""a"" -> cannot access a

 Good luck for fixing all this! Except that everything is good I think
 PS: Don't hesitate to re-arange your files structure with something a little bit more clear like a folder for the builtins, one for parsing, exec, etc..."
"ddyankov","Outstanding project guys!!!! good luck with the next evaluator!!! they explained everything I asked and also the code was clean, easy to read to understand."
"ddyankov","good project, the team handled a lot of cases which arent even in the subject and could explain their stuff very well"
"ddyankov","Nice minishell. Unfortunately there were some minor mistakes. Some exit codes were not right, unsetting the environment with ""env -i"" lead to weird behavior in some cases (executing ""env"" said path not found, which is weird). SHLVL and PATH wasn't updated when opening new shells or changing directories. Good luck when fixing it and hopefully next time will be better already!
 See you next time, and thanks for your explanations! (:"
"ddyankov","there were some issues, they know how to fix it. good luck next time"
"ddyankov","good work, clean code. no mem.leaks , no errors. Viel Erfolg"

"ddyankov","Thank you very much for the explaining all the functions,how it works,  we made all the test cases described in the eval sheet! We discussed for hours :) But always very friendly and took his time to explain which I really appreciate!

"ddyankov","unfortunately the project had small mistakes, such as forgetting to initialize values before checking them in a loop as well as printing overlapping death statuses of philosophers. we talked about potential solutions for the problems and discussed the rest of the code. good luck for the next try"
"ddyankov","Program works fine, sadly some valgrind errors with wrong input. But he knows how to fix it :) explained his code and knows his stuff! Good luck with the next push :) "
"ddyankov","great job, tested every possible cases and no error couldn't found , he explained the code in detail and answered all my questions . good luck with your further projects!"
"ddyankov","Good project and well explained, nice solution to have fewer steps, i should have implemented that too. Also freed everything correctly! GL on future projects"
"ddyankov","Better version of radix sort, which was cool. Didn't know that you could do it like that to improve the performance, but it worked and it got him one more point!
 I couldn't find any leaks and the input was handled well, with one exception. But its debatable if that is a problem or not. I think it's okay because he could explain it, and I'm sure it will be an easy fix!
 Good luck with the next and last evaluation and see you next time! :)"
"ddyankov","Everything works just as it should! Explained every bit of the code well, was friendly and kind! Good luck!

"ddyankov","Good work. The VM works very good. He explain me his way how i create the VM, What SSH, UFW and other thinks are and how it works.We have rigorously gone through all the predefined questions.  He also has the Bonus Part.

 as expected you know how to use fork and how to make the tester not stop on segfault or any other kind of crash.

 The code is pretty simple and streight forward, so I cannot say much against that.

 Small confusion with the test folders but everything still worked out great. "

For you to know: The prototype to Wordle was originally created by software engineer Josh Wardle in 2013, with the name of the game being a play on his last name. During Covid-19, he had been playing many word games alongside his partner Palak Shah. This period of time encouraged him to create a new game that they could play together."

 Курку нарізати великими шматками, смажити на олії 5-8 хвилин до утворення рум'яної скоринки. Курку дістати, замість неї покласти на сковороду бекон, готувати 5 хвилин. Додати нарізані гриби і цибулю, а також подрібнений чебрець - обсмажувати 5-8 хвилин на середньому вогні. Всипати борошно, перемішати, влити молоко і бульйон, викласти в сковороду курку. Довести до кипіння, тушкувати 30 хвилин на повільному вогні. Викласти начинку в форму для запікання з високими бортиками. Розкатати листкове тісто, накрити їм форму для випічки, відрізати зайві шматки. Змастити тісто збитим яєчним жовтком, випікати в духовці 30 хвилин при 200 °C.  Bon apetit!"

"dkohn","The team done good job. Minor issues with commands: echo -n -n, exit n 1, signals: Ctrl C then CTRL D not passing the exit status, CTRL-\ in blocking commands does not do anything, when limited fds program is stuck because to many open files(probably no closing the fds somewhere properly), libf/ : command not found instead of directory. It should be all easy fix good luck with it."
"dkohn","Tho I havent done the porject, i tried to ask questions about the wasy they did, i found a difference betwwen the bash and the code itself, when you put cat | cat | ls the bash does ls and then it executes but they did in the other way, im really not sure whether its a problem or not, but i guess others who already done the project will tell them as their evaluators. In overall great code."

"dpadenko","Great work, we went through the whole code and Daria explained well the bitwise operations and helpedme to understand. The program worked as expected. She also did the bonus part but unfortunately it wasnt correctly included in the Makefile but otherwise it was well done.  "
"dpadenko","Good work, the programs behave as expected, no crashes or other failures were discovered during the tests. She was able to explain her code and its underlying workings and showed good mastery of it. Good luck further on!"
"dpadenko","well done, the program is passing big numbers of bits, we checked it 100000 bits and it sent it fast, I wish you luck."
"dpadenko","Nice code, the project works well and Daria explained it all. Unfortunately, the prinft folder was empty. Good luck with the next evaluation."
"dpadenko","Nice and readable code, good explanation and I learned how can get next line leak and cause problems. Thanks and good luck! "
"dpadenko","fine project, maybe you should use an array or linked list to save the input instead of many gnl.
 good luck:)"
"dpadenko","The project looks great, for the future, don't use get_next_line 5 times. Good Luck."
"dpadenko","Very complex and interesting algorithm! You were able to explain it well and the code passed all of the tests easily. Good job, keep up the good work!"
"dpadenko","Nicely done. Very clean code and good exolaination. No leaks found. Good luck with the next eval."
"dpadenko","Very well done - I checked all the tests mentioned above and the program performed very well - even with 500 numbers. Great work! Good luck with the next evals! :)"
"dpadenko","Great job. clean code. Handled almost all the errors , except for ./push_swap 18446744073709551615 4 2. No leaks found, and error were written with ft_printf not stderr. Otherwise well done. Good luck next time."
"dpadenko","Unfortunately something went wrong in the last minute push, there seemed to be a conflict and when Daria tried to resolve it printf seemed to be deleted in the process. "

"dpadenko","Very nice work and great understanding of everything done! keep up the great work!"
"dpadenko","you put a lot of efforts in writing your own code - congratulation for that! because it was not easy. Check the Makefile and do not forget to check the norm manually. Also remember writting errors in the right file descriptor. Something that you also have to remember is to check in the man what the fonction you are using is returning on errors and if you should check the return value or not. I appreciated the discussion and your questions. I wish you good luck for the end of your piscine!"
"dpadenko","Daria's code looks super clean and logic to me !! good work :) and good luck with Moulinette!!!"

"dscholz","Great works. Could explain his code really good. Keep up the good work."
"dscholz","The previues evaluator found a bug should be easz ti fix for next one good luck!"
"dscholz","Daniel did a great job explaining his code, unfortunatly there was a small mistake where philosophers did not die when they should have."
"dscholz","Very good job and great explanation! Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge and best luck for your next project!"
"dscholz","Great project, good explaination, well done:)"
"dscholz","everything works fine, looks good to my. checked many combinations of false input everything handled without leaks."
"dscholz","Was a really great project, tried to break it, unfortanetaly couldnt:(  Great JoB!"

"dscholz","Unter LSD wurde die Welt zu einem surrealen Gemälde, in dem Farben tanzten und Muster Geschichten flüsterten. Die Zeit zerfloss, als ich die erste Pille schluckte, Bäume begannen ekstatisch zu schwingen. Ein Rausch der Euphorie übermannte mich, als ich die zweite Dosis nahm und die Realität zu einem flimmernden Schleier wurde. Wiesen verwandelten sich in lebendige Gemälde, jeder Grashalm schien mir Geschichten zu flüstern. Halluzinationen verfälschten die Welt zu einem schwebenden Kunstwerk. Gedanken wirbelten in einem Karussell philosophischer Ideen, meine Verbundenheit mit der Natur wurde tief. Zeit verlor Bedeutung, Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und Zukunft verschmolzen. Doch plötzlich durchfuhr mich unerklärliche Kälte und Furcht. Die Welt wurde zum Albtraum zwischen Wahnsinn und Klarheit. In der Unterstützung von Freunden fand ich Halt und kehrte zurück. LSD war mehr als ein bunter Ausflug – eine Expedition zwischen Ekstase und Erkenntnis."
"dscholz","Great explantion and help how to write the project and how to think, what to do! Explantion how to aproach new project was also a great help! Thank you! "
"dscholz","I tried everything, went through all lines of code, and it's all so impressive I cannot even express myself. wow. well done! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ :))"
"dscholz","Sorry for the delay! Good discussion, we talked about our different approaches! The program didnt exceed the limits of the moves! Good luck!"
"dscholz","Did not protect malloc everywhere, otherwise was a really clean and readable project. Good luck next time!"
"dscholz","Nice that you were willing to still go through everything even though we already knew that there were leaks. Thanks for all the discussions, this was educational :-)"
"dscholz","He explained his code very well and I feel like he put alot of affort into it. Unforginatelly I found alot of missing malloc protections and some places where double frees could occure. Besides that if there is just one number and it is bigger than an int he doesnt print out error. Other than that a very cool push swap! You will definetly make it next time!!"
"dscholz","Very good work, everything seems in order. Good Job! also accidental bonus points!"
"dscholz","Good evaluation, everything works fine, good job ^^"
"dscholz","Explained the project quite good, I was asking questions about the password managament, after the eval will be my setting up way easier!"

"dscholz","Good work, everything works fine and he explained his code very well. good luck :)"
"dscholz","Very nice work, I could not find any issue with the code, good job!"
"dscholz","Great guy, his ft_split code is reallly entertaining, laughed about it several minutes!"
"dscholz","Very nice code, and the person could explain it very well. Some original solutions were used. Cool! Thank you for taking your time to discuss everything!"
"dscholz","Nice code and discussion - good luck!"
"dscholz","grate :)"
"dscholz","compiled all fine, well explained, nice clean code"
"dscholz","all good and clean. problems on ex02 and 03 appear to be fixed, good luck!"
"dscholz","Did a great job, very friendly person!"
"dscholz","explained very well, good luck:)"

"dscholz","good job, clean code. keep going"
"dscholz","Added the header in the failed exercice so should be good now! :) "
"dscholz","Good job ^_^"
"dscholz","Sadly main isn't comented out :-/"
"dscholz","Good job, explains were good and everything is working as expected

 Next time be careful about the usage of global variables

 Good luck for the rest of the piscine!"
"dscholz","Was everything okay, did a great job!"
"dscholz","Great Work!"
"dscholz","All good. Nice guy. nice evaluation"
"dscholz","good job. very nice work!"
"dscholz","Excelent work, explained everything!"
"dscholz","did a good job "
"dscholz","Good work."
"dscholz","Great Job. He knows his code very Well. Keep it up !!!"
"dscholz","Great work!"
"dscholz","Great work. He done everything. Great guy. Very interesting work. Interesting library."
"dscholz","Seems right. have fun!"
"dscholz","Good team, good explains, worked together
 Be careful, when the subject ask for a function ft_putchar, the content of the function should be an ft_putchar, nothing else

 Also, be careful with the edge cases like the maximum and minimum integer
 Except that, everything is fine!
 Good luck for the next of the piscine! "
"dscholz","Thanks for waiting!! and for all your knowledge and patients!
 "
"dscholz","Explained me his work - did a good job - was very helpful"
"dscholz","Good job! well done! "
"dscholz","great work, keep it up!"
"dscholz","nothing changed since last evaluation, we look at local files to discuss actual changes which will be represented in the next evaluation"
"dscholz","it's mostly there just small mistakes and some confusion, will work the next time!"
"dvaisman","some problems with multiple quotes, other than that everything worked fine. No memory leaks and all fds were closed. good job"
"dvaisman","Good minishell. Almost all mistakes from last time are fixed. Minor issues but we agreed that these are going under go crazy part. Beside that all is good! Good luck with last eval!"
"dvaisman","only ""issue"" was funcheck calling something the subject tells you to ignore, so solid work!"
"dvaisman","The team done good job. Minor issues with commands: echo -n -n, exit n 1, signals: Ctrl C then CTRL D not passing the exit status, CTRL-\ in blocking commands does not do anything, when limited fds program is stuck because to many open files(probably no closing the fds somewhere properly), libf/ : command not found instead of directory. It should be all easy fix good luck with it."
"dvaisman","Tho I havent done the porject, i tried to ask questions about the wasy they did, i found a difference betwwen the bash and the code itself, when you put cat | cat | ls the bash does ls and then it executes but they did in the other way, im really not sure whether its a problem or not, but i guess others who already done the project will tell them as their evaluators. In overall great code."
"dvaisman","Good work. The game looks nice. Animations are cool. We tested the code and it works well with no memory leaks. Good job and good luck. :)"
"dvaisman","Amazing project. Understood everything. I liked the jumping chests. Good Luck! "
"dvaisman","Very nice job David, I like it! The game was playable, running very smooth and even faster animations (of the enemies) with Valgrind! There were no leaks and very clean code, and explained well. Works well also with given empty map. Very well done! Good luck with the other evaluations :) "
"dvaisman","Really good so_long, explains were fine, everything have been correctly understood, interresting way of doing the frames with usage of the time.h library, good job!

 Unfortunately, with an empty map you have a leak, game->map_alloc was not changed to true after map initialization, you could remove it from your while loop and put it before to solve this problem.
 You can also try to reduce some unnecessary elements in your code like in the init part & in your gnl a condition which is not needed.
 Good luck for fixing this little thing and good luck for the next try!"
"dvaisman","Great job implementing the animations! looks awesome, no leaks, no errors , really robust code. nice!!  hopefully 5th time youll make it !"
"dvaisman","Very nice project, everything is fixed and the game looks very good.
 Congrats and good luck for minishell:)"
"dvaisman","Previous evaluator found gcc in place of cc in the Makefile. "
"dvaisman","Very nicely coded but sadly Makefile compiles with gcc instead of cc, and does not compile with cc. Sorry man. Good luck next time."
"dvaisman","Unfortunately there were some fd leaks. The program run smooth and the code seemed fine. It was even super smooth with valgrind which is something I haven't really seen before so good job. Good luck fixing it and see you around! :)"
"dvaisman","Well done, everything seems to be working properly, I have not managed to find any leaks. The bonuses are done well, too. Good luck with the following evaluations!"
"dvaisman","had a nice conversation, there was a small mistake Unitialised value .. Sorry man!!"
"dvaisman","Everything looks great, explained his code very well and everything was working! Great work! :D"
"dvaisman","Game looks good. But when we checked the images there was a memory leak when importing the images. One pointer wasn't freed correctly. But David found the leak very fast so the next evaluation shouldn't be far ahead. GL for the next one!"
"dvaisman","good job! tested all different case and all passed. no data race or leaks. also when sleep or eat time was too high, stimulation stopped as expected whenever a philo died."
"dvaisman","Great work, good luck for the future! :)"
"dvaisman","WONDEFUL JOB , Really a bachir material!"
"dvaisman","Thank you for your time and the proper explanation of everything. Unfortunately the enemies would destroy the door in the bonus, so some minus points there. Besides that, the animation and implementation of that was very interesting and well thought out! I loved the sprites and your code looked very clean and well structured. Looking forward to see your next projects! Good luck with that and see you :)"
"dvaisman","Nice work congratulations. IThe game runs smoothly, not leaks, no errors. Only sprite animation is a bit lagging. good luck!"
"dvaisman","Hey guys. I just evaluated David on so_long. We had a really nice conversation as always. He explained me the code very well. I find it cool how he checks if the map is valid to play and how he implements the algorithm. The code is pretty understandable and the function are clear to read and to understand what is he doing  and how exactly is everything happenin. I tested all the wrong map possibliities, I hope i didnt miss something. There are no leaks . It is a lot of memory allocation because of the real time rendering but he manages to free everything on time .. Game is fine , playable and looks good to me. For  the bonus a gave both 4 points because it can be done even better in my opinion the rendering and the movmenets count on the screen !! I was evaluated like that so .. David i think you did great , keep it up!!!"
"dvaisman","His program worked fine and he explained everything well, but the second bonus part (Acknowledgement) was not correct. He just checked if the client sends the bits and not if the server actually received them."
"dvaisman","Everything works perfectly and also very fast! Nice implementation of a global variable. Bonus also works without errors. Well done! "
"dvaisman","nicely done project, code looks good and explained why he used a global variable and pause instead of usleep well. Was nice to see someone doing the entire minitalk_bonus. Good luck on so_long "
"dvaisman","unfortunately the makefile is relinking and some rturn of functions are not checked. Tha is a pity because I have the feeling that he made a really good job and asks himself how to handle his programms in a better way than with sleep and signal. Thanks a lot and sorry !!!!"
"dvaisman","Makefile didn’t relink other than that his project was very good and worked completely fine. Code looked good as well and he could explain everything to me. Thank u anyways :)"
"dvaisman","great job, he explained it very well and it was a clean code, he also fixed the problems from the last evaluation. very good error handling and NO LEAKS. Keep up the good work and good luck with Minitalk."
"dvaisman","Thank you very much for the great explanation, I learned a lot! Very good job!"
"dvaisman","David did a really good job here. He understood and explained his code very well. Nice work :)"
"dvaisman","Nice code. But unfortunately had memory leaks. SORRY"
"dvaisman","Great Job , He explained his code thoroughly and answered all my questions. Good luck with your further projects ."
"dvaisman","unfortunately some leaks when argument is """"  and no Error when there is ""-"" or ""+"" in argument"
"dvaisman","Generally, it was a good project! The peer confidently answered all the questions related to the algorithm. Nevertheless, I graded it with 0 because of a memory leak when the program exited with an error message (the memory was not properly freed). It should be easy to fix, and I wish you luck with the next try!"
"dvaisman","Unfortunately there are memory leaks when there is an incorrect argument input. Otherwise good project, every test worked perfectly! Good luck!"
"dvaisman","Great explanations Thank u!! will help me very much with my own project :) Code look great too."
"dvaisman","Nice code eplained everything very well to me was very helpful for my own project thank u :)"
"dvaisman","Good project, he answered all my questions and was very friendly. He did also the bonus part. we create Mains and teseted it. all works good. We had a nice discussion about Buffer, good luck :)  "
"dvaisman","Very nice Code, everything works as expected. Good Job. Good Luck with Moulinette :)"
"dvaisman","David was so much fun to evaluate and his code was extraordinary!!"
"dvaisman","Very good work. Explained it very understandable and my test were also all successful. All in all a successful work. Good luck. "
"dvaisman","Thanks for the evaluation. David explained not only his code but also why he chose some options. We ran some test and compiled the lib from his make file with his own main. Also the first time i see a makefile running the libft makefile."
"dvaisman","thorough, good explanations. Could answer all my questions. Great job"
"dvaisman","Great explanation, was also able to fix some minor problems that we stumbled upon – showed that he really knows his stuff :) "
"dvaisman","Great work , Everything worked and the signature was the same.Good luck on future projects!"
"dvaisman","Well done and well explained. Seems to work, hope Moulinette will say the same. Good luck!"
"dvaisman","very good explanation and nice work^^"
"dvaisman","very good code very clean sehr gut ,
 good luck by next project :)"
"dvaisman","Looks good!
 Good luck with striteri :) "
"dvaisman","good job. unfortunately only ft_striteri.c was missing. even though all testers said OK, there were only 35 files instead 36files. he will submit again. and hopefully that time he will get 100%. good luck for the next time. and thanks for explaining the project."
"dvaisman","Thank you for the evaluation! Although im not at c09 he was able to explain to me every step concisely"

"dvaisman","That's was really good job. But one mistake in ex 01. I wish him luck and power for next projects and also for the exam"
"dvaisman","renamed it but the header was still the previous name. sorry! good luck next time!"
"dvaisman","The code is really interesting,
 There are just 3 norm errors 😞.
 The program crashes with no arguments, but works really good in other cases,
 There are soooome memory leaks,  check the join functions.

 The code compiles properly and there norm is ok.
 And the project is able to solve this case ""4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2""

"gdanis","I liked his implementation of minitalk with bonus. He has a pretty good understanding of his project. He explained the reason why he used a global var and the flow of his code in detail. I have sent 3000 characters with emojis and it works smoothly. I also liked that malloc is only used once in his program. Az alma és a lány. Ez piros busz. közönöm. Hogy vogy? jó reggelt. én nem angol vagyok és ö magyar van. "
"gdanis","Good job, everything is working perfectly."
"gdanis","Very nice code, well structured, and good explonation. Godd luck"
"gdanis","very nice, thank you"
"gdanis","Great work! Quite impressive :) Nice explanations and understanding of a project!"
"gdanis","Unfortunately, ft_itoa return value is not protected, which leads to a segmentation fault in case of memory allocation failure.
 Other than that the code is well written and well explained, I was able to understand everything without having done the project before.
 Well done and sorry about that  :))

"gdanis","Could explain everything in detail and the usage of global vars, could handle upto 2800 chars which is in my option enough, he could also point out how to improve it with a buffer implementation on serverside, friendly and polite defense. Also implemented the handshake and unicode support"
"gdanis","Looks good, he was able to explain everything and why he implemented specific function and the global variables. Good luck with the next evaluations."
"gdanis","He did a good job, everything works fine."
"gdanis","Very good job! Works great, also best instructions count i have seen so far!"

"gdanis","Unfortunately it does not work with standard input. Otherwise it looked pretty good. Good luck tomorrow on the final exam."
"gdanis","These guys wrote a great program that does what the subject wants them to do and did an amazing job. Their code is not able to read the map from the standart input so i have to fail them for that, but im sorry, bc they did well in this hard exercise. Sorry guys. "
"gdanis","Awesome work, unfortunately program couldn't take the map on standard input. Good luck! :D"

"ggero","Hey,

 your `retromfa` works as expected ig, a single file with 167 Norm errors, nice.

 We tried to open 800 images, made the pc almost crash, I hope Elidjah does not see this.

 Good luck and have fun with the next Rushes!"
"ggero","Great project! It was like really painful to get through this rush - but You guys did it! I am very proud of you! In case of norminette you could do better - only 168. So good luck for the next eval!"
"ggero","Very nice implementation. The whole project works and is nice to look at the code. It is very organized. Very impressive for a new language in this small amount of time to learn and implement it. Very pleasant evaluation too. They know their stuff. Thank you."
"ggero","Okay! That was very impressive. Simon and Gabe did a terrific job navigating through the jungle of yasl language. I tried to understand as much as i could, but honestly, it is quite difficult to wrap my brain around all of it. The appetizer and the main course have been done very nicely, good job! :)"
"ggero","Looks great, passes all the tests, good explanations."
"ggero","The program works like its supposed to :3. There are some things to remember though: Error messages do give more detailed information for the cause of error not stated in the subject.
 This is debatably a better choice, however don't deviate too much, that it becomes a different assignment. ALSO ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, please don't global variables. In this case it may be overlooked because the function containing the gv is not used, but be CAREFUL in the future!!! ANYWAY great work and keep up it up! >w> "
"ggero","Thanks a lot for all the explanations! We checked everything, it all works very well and there are no leaks. Cool solution!"
"ggero","Very interesting project I discovered. All my questions were well explained. Very good work."

"ggero","Good job, it seems like all work properly , good luck!"
"ggero","Very advanced and precise, well thought code. Nice job."
"ggero","Project works fine, previous problems are solved now, knows his code very well, only possible problem that might be an issue is that there is no header file included, otherwise great work."
"ggero","When the infile didn't have read permissions the program went into an infinite loop - which is a very specific test case. Everything else was very well handled though and Gabor thought of everything else. Also very knowledgeable about many other tools and even assembly, I was impressed."
"ggero","Sadly he accepts more then 4 arguments and had a permission issue for the second file so you cant read it without changing permission. apart from that its nicely done. Good luck next time ^^"
"ggero","Nice work, did all the necessary work and could explain everything. No mistakes found"
"ggero","great job, the explanations were on point and we went through everything  in checklist and it was fine. gl"
"ggero","Great job! Was explaining his work very well. Nice way of doing your job. Good luck!"
"ggero","Great explanation! Knows how the VM works, and knows all the commands. But, unfortunately, there was a small mistake in password expiration rule for root and main user. I'm sure you will definitely pass next time. I'm really sorry. Keep it up! Otherwise, nice work:)"
"ggero","Everything works properly, clear explanation, good luck)"
"ggero","Nice work, moulinette should accept it as well.. Good luck !!"
"ggero","learned a lot of new code snippets, good luck for the last one! "
"ggero","This is super solid, I am impressed. Thank you for the discussions!"
"ggero","Great work, and the person really knows very well what they are doing. I will be back for some more teaching. Thanks a lot for all the explanations!"
"ggero","Could explain the code well. Good work."
"ggero","Good job. Get next line works as it should. Tested with francinette. "
"ggero","Everything was correct and ggero explained the code well, good job "
"ggero","as always great codes by you good luck."
"ggero","Everything works, except for different function encapsulation structure, looks good for me but may be not recognised by moulinette. Good job tho, creative approach :D"
"ggero","Everything looks good. Great explanation. Good luck"
"ggero","Code looks good to me"
"ggero","tank you very match :)"
"ggero","Unlucky with norminette."

"ggero","good, clean code, everything well explained. forgot to change ex03. it will surely work next time."
"ggero","Wrong folder. Invalid compilation Malloc open read not protected. They tried it but could not finished it. Keep going. gg :)"
"ggero","sadly norm mistake Code seems fine, good luck"
"ggero","unluckily a norm error - still explained his code very well! Keep going:)"

"ggero","small mistake on ex02 and ex03, but very clever coding!"
"ggero","looks like you fixed the error from the previous try! code look clean and correct now, good job!"
"ggero","Looks like everything is fixed now, great job! Very easy to read code, very understandable."
"ggero","Code looks good and he explained his thought process well. Couldn't test because there aren't any main functions. Otherwise good job!"
"ggero","nice work! small mistake in atoi. GL!"
"ggero","Very nice and friendly. Explained his code very well. Unfortunately ex01 isn't running correctly due to a small typo. Keep it up. Thank you very much."
"ggero","everything was great. learned a lot. thank you ! :)"
"ggero","but its good work"
"ggero","Great work, he forgot the main class in ex01. Small errors causing big problems .

 Good luck in the future."
"ggero","Explained well his code, small error in ex03, evrything else is good."
"ggero","a little mistake on the ex02, but generally very thoughtful design of the code! good work!!!"
"ggero","good codes. not sure on ex03. chill dude. good luck. "
"ggero","well done ggero, nice implementation, all the best"
"ggero","some stupid mistake, keep going it will be fine"
"ggero","Input handling is working. But they had no working code for solving the problem. They had an idea how to solve it. Good luck at the piscine. Keep it up gg :)"
"ggero","Very well done."
"ggero","codes look good good luck."
"ggero","great work!"
"ggero","would have loved testcases, but good work regardless"
"ggero","clean code / ex09 it doesnt work perfctly . great person"
"ggero","Haven't reached this project so far, so I cannot properly evaluate if he got it correct. However, he was helpful with his guidance for me."
"ggero","nice work :)
 sadly failed on checking for 0 and negative numbers for y
 also max INT didnt work

 talked a bit about how to avoid these things in the future, explained argc, argv, and talked about the write function :))

 gl with next exam and rush <3"
"ggero","very code but a small mistake in 9th exercise would be corrected easily"
"ggero","Good understanding of code.
 There is just a small mistake in ex06"
"ggero","Thank you. Nice evaluation. Gabe seems to know his stuff. On ex06 the DEL should be included. On ex09 : between numbers it capitalizes. ex11 dashtime and check the numbers. "
"ggero","everything looked fine to me, very clever coding!!"
"ggero","clean code but check norminette next time :)"
"ggero","unfortunate typo in ex04"
"ggero","empty git repo"
"ggero","Looks very good, good clean work! "
"ggero","Very impressive work!"
"ggero","Everything works as it supposed to be and he knows the Exercisises very well. Keep it Up!!!!!"
"ggero","good explanation! friendly and polite :)"
"ggero","all good"
"ggero","everything works perfectly"
"ggero","Nice Project, forgot a 42 in a file, all Commands seemed right otherwise, good work."
"ggero","Good job"
"ggero","empressed! ex06 was wrong"
"ggero","take a look the ex01 and ex03
 remember to use #!/bin/sh and execution permission
 thank you nice guy:D"
"ggero","all is working"
"ggero","Very nice job"
"ggero","unusual, but works fine) "
"ggero","Okay."
"ggero","Was able to explain what his mistake was, evaluation finished because of first error."
"ggero","hardcoded printing in ex01. did stop evaluation here"
"ggero","Some little work left to do."
"ggero","forgot to delete some files, good work otherwise :)"
"gkonstan","Excellent project! and the explanations! I'm very grateful I evaluated you because you explained everything very detailed.
 Good luck with the C++ project, and see you around."
"gkonstan","We go thorough the eval sheet and tested, everything worked fine. good luck"
"gkonstan","everything tested manually and with tester from github. explanations were very good. had different valid and invalid maps to test. "
"gkonstan","Sadly the mlx_new_window doesnt exit properly in function ""initialize_window"", the project is made so well they even protected hidden files. It hurts when I have to fail this! but you all know how to correct it and good luck!!!"
"gkonstan","Great cub3D, finally this cub3D is set free. It is working perfectly, nothing leaking, everything protected. Good job!"
"gkonstan","Looks great, now the team covered all the bases, crossed all their t's and dotted all the i's. No leaks, no unhandled error cases, all input files protected, great work!"
"gkonstan","Small error in configuration file, defining colors like ""F"" and ""C"" they only check  first letter so ""FGARBAGE"" is valid and not error. Good luck"
"gkonstan","So sad but you know what to do. The textures name shouldnt be double xD good luck"
"gkonstan","Sadly it had a segfault at the condition, if the map has only spaces :("
"gkonstan","Unfortnatly there was an segfault with(ulimit -v 6500; ./cub3D maps/map1.cub) => mlx_new_image wasn't protected. So should be an easy fix. Otherwise everythings works as expected!
 Good luck for the next time.
 "
"gkonstan","Explained everything step by step, very interesting project! wish you goodluck!"
"gkonstan","The Players starting position unfortunately doesn't align with the starting position shown in the Map files. It seems like the map seems to be flipped left to right or right to left. Everything else seems to be implemented perfectly, no leaks and no other issues found. Good luck on your next evluations!"
"gkonstan",".cub file accepted (so it is a hidden file). Check that the len is atleast 5.
 Map content can not be separated by newlines, but in ur case it's possible
 Textures checked only for first two letters (should check the whole token) example: EAA - is valid, should be not. Also you arg like '      EA       ./path' should be valid
 No memleaks found so I assume ez fixes for u. GL"
"gkonstan","Well done! Congrats to the tam with passed project! Keep up the good job!"
"gkonstan","Everything looks good to me, and he was able to explain the concept of virtual functions and abstract classes very well. I was unfamiliar with it up until today and I was able to follow him. gl, gg"
"gkonstan","The program works correctly, no leaks. The explanation is ok. "
"gkonstan","explained everything clearly, and checked all the points. no memory leak, good work."
"gkonstan","Good work, everything works as expected, explanations were clear. Gl :)"
"gkonstan","Great code! He explained everything perfectly! It is always nice seeing c++ and getting it explained from PROFESSIONALS!!!!! Good job:)
 "
"gkonstan","Grigorii has good knowledge about the floating point numbers, i really enjoy the evaluation and the discussion we had:) There are some weird behaviors, for == operator for 9999.99f and 9999f numbers, but we consider that it is specific of the computer calculations. Well done, good luck with next modules!"
"gkonstan"," Dear Gregori, I learned a lot about the module. Thanks to you I will be able to do the module faster because of your good explanation. Now I have a image of the project :) "
"gkonstan","Great job student explained everything correctly and checked every error case.Good luck on future projects!"
"gkonstan","Thanks for all the explanations. Great error handling with charm :)"
"gkonstan","Thank you for the interesting evaluation. The project is an introduction into the world of c++ but you can clearly see that he had LOADS of fun implementing especially the phonebook and the error handling, loved the easter eggs. Thanks a lot for the explanation"
"gkonstan","Good explanation. He made me get the subject which is nice. All in all good job. :)"
"gkonstan","Great work! Could explain everything in detail. Knows how to set the routes and how to to configure teh ip adresses. Great guy!"
"gkonstan","Good job, all levels passed without any problems, all connections could be established. Guy knows what he's talking about!"
"gkonstan","good work, tested everything and introduced me into minishell. thank you Nikoll & Grigorii :)"
"gkonstan","Thank you for explaining me everything in this huge project. I will definetely come to you when i will have problem with this few months later. Good luck with next project. "
"gkonstan","Minishell is good, everything works and no leaks or crashes. Code was explained and i think the boys understand everything and suffered enough.

 There were small differences (in every minishell project), in there project:
 - $ expansion in heredoc wasnt supported
 - no space in export was allowed
 - didnt like that the pipes were running with |||||| and no error message
 Except that everything was covered, some parts are very detailed."
"gkonstan","Good minishell, some problems creating segfault with the exit (exit | exit 42)
 Good luck for fixing this and for the next push! Otherwise everything is fine"
"gkonstan","they explained their code in details it took us almost 2 hours, they fixed the previous errors and everything worked fine. good luck with your further projects "
"gkonstan","all bugs in previous evaluations have been fixed, we tested them one by one. also tested with minishell tester program, which couldnt find any segfaults or leaks/errors. everything looks good. and explained well."
"gkonstan","In general good minishell but few little mistakes:

 ajsdfkljasdfj -> command not found
 echo $? -> Invalid read/write

 export a=""test""
 echo $a -> Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

 mkdir -p a/b/c/d
 cd a/b/c/d/
 rm -rf ../../../../
 pwd -> Memory leak (but no segfault)

  cat << test.txt
 heredocs -> new lines

 But they fixed the error of previous evaluation. Good luck with the project!"
"gkonstan","Good explains
 The work have been splited correctly, after checking everything with you,we found some problem, more or less everything is explained in details here -> https://pastebin.com/MWezwNUC

 You should also take a look in your makefile, some rules can be changed, like the fact that it's creating directories for every file that will be compiled and also regarding your malloc handling sometimes, you are exiting without checking that everything have been freed correctly before.

 Good luck for all these fixes and curious to see how it will looks like after that!
 Have a nice day!"
"gkonstan","Everything works, no errors found. Also cases, which were wrong during previous defenses, are correct. Great explanation, deep understanding of the topic. "
"gkonstan","Everything works as expected, He explained his code and even wrote a really cool tester!"
"gkonstan","Really great stuff, made an insanely good checker!"
"gkonstan","Explains are good, everything have been understood correctly and the code is clean

 Some points have to be fixed before repushing:
 - In your while loop in the main, when str is NULL, it will produce a segfault because you will access str[j] which will be undefined
 - Overflows not handled correctly, if I put by example 2 ^ 123 - 1, it will consider it as a value lower than max integer
 - One error message is not in the good output (STDOUT and not STDERR)

 Good luck for fixing these little things and for the repush!
 Have a nice day!"
"gkonstan","very good muchgood thank you good project. handled everything asked for. a ton of effort and code pulled into this most obviously good job guys!"
"gkonstan","Both team members came to the evaluation. They performed quite well! I gave them a tip to make handling exitstatus easier in their future projects :)
 Grigori showed great understanding of the project, but so did Nikoll !!!
 Both had there strengths and weaknesses but knew more that enough about their code and the project itself.
 They make a wonderful team together.
 Tested rigorously, no norm errors, no leaks!

 GOOD JOB !
 Keep it up :)"
"gkonstan","The Students provided an explanation on how it works and responded to all of my inquiries. Best of luck!"
"gkonstan","Absolut fantastisch. Echtes Talent und eine strahlende Zukunft!"

"gkonstan","Great job!"
"gkonstan","Great work!"
"gkonstan","Thank you for submitting the Philosophers Project. I have carefully reviewed Grigorii's code and I am impressed with the quality of his work. Not only did he create a very nice implementation of the Philosophers Dining Problem, but he was also able to explain all aspects of the project well.

 I have run all the tests and found Grigorii's code to be very solid. Particularly impressive was the fact that no data races or memory leaks were found, demonstrating that Grigorii has a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and technologies.

 Overall, Grigorii's work was very professional and well thought out. I recommend that he continue to produce such excellent work in the future. Thank you for your work, and good luck on future projects!"
"gkonstan","Thanks for explanation, good job man. You teach me something new and give me good instruction how to build a project."
"gkonstan","Nice chat with Grigorii, he explained me what is the project about from the very beginning. We checked different inputs , error handling is done well. He corrected his mistake from last time. No memory leaks. We talked about threads and how to understand them easily .. Good job. I learend new stuff. Keep going !!"
"gkonstan","everything worked as expected and he seems to really understand his code we even tried some fancy things was fun!! :)"
"gkonstan","very good work, sadly put pixel instead of put pixel in image. dont be sad i still love you <3"
"gkonstan","Awesome work! Is very fun to play around with it, change colors, zoom etc.! Also got great explanations and presentations of the functions. Thank you for the input and good luck!"
"gkonstan","Great work, Great peer. Keep up the brilliant work, NO LEAKS, NO CRASH- everything good. "
"gkonstan","keep up the good work!! :)"
"gkonstan","as usual, gkonstant's work is flawless - he created a highly efficient algorithm based on quicksort. I learned a lot since I have the project still outstanding. thank you very much"
"gkonstan","Tests were all executed - no errors found.
 Thank you for taking the time to explain in detail - very appreciated!"
"gkonstan","Project looks really clean code wise, sadly it sometimes messes up the characters when a signal is lost. Best practice would be to build an handshake so every packet/signal gets acknowledged."
"gkonstan","Very good work. keep up the good work. Good luck. :)"
"gkonstan","He explained his code very very well to me and he was able to answered all my questions. Thank u i learned a lot :)"
"gkonstan","took my time to torture this guy with a hundred questions. explained everything with patience and calmness. CPACIbA"
"gkonstan","Very nice work, it gave me the first 40 lines of pride and prejudice on demand which is all I can ask for from a function that is supposed to get the line, I tested with several Buffer sizes and also multiple file descriptors everything works as it should. Norminette is happy. the test scripts as well. grigorii could explain his code and the thought processes behind it very well. Nice project."
"gkonstan","great work"
"gkonstan","Code work with my tests, Bonus included...can explain his code"
"gkonstan","very nice project. bonus part is included and right too. thats our gregori! well done brother and very Xorosho. :) "
"gkonstan","Great explanation! Everything worked fine, also did the bonus. Good luck! "
"gkonstan","he explained me the whole project and it was very interesting he did a good job and everything looks fine, good luck !"
"gkonstan","Outstanding project! Talked about what VMs are and why you would use them. Asked about Debian and CentOS, could explain what SELinux / AppArmor and apt / aptitude are. We checked and reconfigured the hostname, everything is working! Partitions are similar to the bonus part of the project. Sudo, ssh and ufw are all there and correctly configured. Talked about the Monitoring script, he explained to me how it works, what cron is and how it's setup to run the script every 10 minutes. Bonus part has been done nicely. We did it together so I know what he did. Good job!"
"gkonstan","Well done! "
"gkonstan","Good evaluation, i feel like i understood most of the things you explained even though i didnt even start the project jet. Thanks for taking the time to explain it.
 Also, did you know: If you were to check your height, you are taller in the morning compared to night."
"gkonstan","Good job, good luck with mouli)"
"gkonstan","Good work. Interesting approach with %u. Funny code. :)"
"gkonstan","very good code very clean he explained the strchr and the Bonus Part very well good luck"
"gkonstan","Had Libft on 100% did Bonus now. Looks very clean, great work on that. Thanks for explaining the functions i had problems with!

"hluo","jaaaaaa, sehr gut gute arbeit, ich bin stolz auf dich.
 VERY GOOD CODE"
"hluo","Everything works fine only thing i didnt like was the use of a pointer int the main to t_data instead of using data and passing the address of it. Some nice logic/ideas in the code i didnt see before. But also some parts are more complicated than it needs to be. Good luck have fun. "

"huaydin","Code works and offers the functionality needed. Some things details are not supported.  Otherwise working server.
 Code could be cleaner, had some unnecessary lines"
"huaydin","Very nice project. Everything worked as expected. The explanation were also good. It was a pleasure to evaluate these guys. Thanks."
"huaydin","Noice! We went through all the things and everything looks top. Server responds to every client, even if some are kicked. Everybody has a good understanding of what was implemented in the code. Cool project!"

"huaydin","I checked everything and could not find any error . He explained the project thoroughly."
"huaydin","Great Work!! All so good explained,  maybe I will need your help later!! :))"
"huaydin","Code:
 - sometimes too long like in btc exercise main is longer than manual, break it down
 - c cast was used but only on ""up-casting""
 - some functions which dont change any class values were not const

 Otherwise the explanation of the subject and the code was good.
 Also a very thorough Error handling although not required (claps)!

 Good luck and fun on the future projects. Always thankful for your help. Great peer!! <3"
"huaydin","Very good project. Could explain everything well. Especially the FJ Sort was implemeneted in a clean and understandable way!!"

"huaydin","The code is clear and readable, the peer can explain the code really thorough, i really like it, keep it up! "
"huaydin","Nice chat as always with Hüseyin , tested the 3 different exercises, nice approach with always generating different numbers in ex02 instead of initiliazing a lot of test cases... Great!!!"
"huaydin","Great work! Even though i had no prior knowledge in c++ he was able to explain everything so I was able to understand it. Thank you for the insights & good luck!"
"huaydin","well done! there was a missing function in ex02 and a minor flaw in how the variables, always a great discussion with you, good luck with the next modules and thank you!"
"huaydin","Nice work! We checked the code and everything looks good. One function was sadly missing but this is an easy fix. Everything else works as intended. Noice!"
"huaydin","I tested the project thoroughly couldn't find any errors, no memory leaks or forbidden functions. they explained the code in detail. good job!"
"huaydin","The code is really well structured and easy to read, keep it up! Good luck with next projects!"
"huaydin","Very thorough explanation, pointed me already to resources I can use when I have to do the program. Very friendly and overall a pleasant eval. Best of luck."
"huaydin","Very good explanation, helped me for my projects and understanding. Good job!"
"huaydin","The pleasure to check this work again, accidentaly failed it last but not this time hopefully. Good luck:)"
"huaydin","Great work, i was guided trough cpp exercises 4 times already and now i feel like i am ready to take this project myself. Had a lot of fun and learned much. Thank you and good luck with achievement!!:) "
"huaydin","great sry for my last evaluation, i was so impressed that i didnt check cin.eof (ctrl + d) in the while loop i saw the cin.eof in the main loop for the phonebook and listened to your explanation and missed to check the second while loop good luck for the next projects."
"huaydin","Very nice project, thanks for taking the time to explain everything:)"
"huaydin","Great work! Did the last exercise compared to the previous submission and nailed it. Again, very informative and exciting evaluation. Thank you!"
"huaydin","control d  in check phone number caused an infinite loop unfortunately :( but everything else is ok easy fix"
"huaydin","very thorough error handling, i learned a lot which i didnt expect since its the first c++ project. It was nice talking with u about the code and project. Great work !"
"huaydin","extremely nice and clean code, well explained and working fine! great job keep it goin :3"
"huaydin","Great job, perfect explanation, i learned a lot and could understand what was going on. Thank you:) Good Luck!"
"huaydin","Everything looks fine, but sadly he used protected attributes instead of private attributes in ex00. Should be an easy fix though :) good luck for the next try! "
"huaydin","good job, Hü.. thanks for the explanations and the suggestions how to do it by myself !"
"huaydin","nice chat as always .. was pretty fast at solving the Network problems !!!"
"huaydin","Great work, explained everything to me as I am not that far yet. Very understandable and readable code, thanks for the explanation!"
"huaydin","Thank you for the evaluation, I have an overview now from the project!"
"huaydin","Clean code, everything works as intended. good job and good luck with the next module ! :)"
"huaydin","levels 6, 7, 8 done in under 5 min nice. you also understand the subnetting principles :)"
"huaydin","We looked through the examples, everything worked perfectly. He also explained some basic networking terms and we discussed subnetting a bit. Nice work :D"
"huaydin","well done, learned a lot about the coming projects and gained knowledge about some new concepts for me (also saw that VS code seems to interpret references in a interesting way). really enjoyed the evaluation, thank you"
"huaydin","nice Code sadly no BSP otherwise a really nice Code good job and keep up :)"
"huaydin","perfect execution, was able to explain everything well and in detail. I would recommend to shorten some functions in ex04 to improve readability, but everything else is executed well and in line with OOP concepts. well done"
"huaydin","Thanks a lot for the evaluation and taking so much time. We were not sure if new has to be protected as it is possible to protect it without exception handling. We did not find a clear statement about pragma once beeing the include guards asked by the subject. Wiki said it has the same purpose. Thanks again for your time!!!!!!!"
"huaydin","Good job, explains were good, be careful with your exercice 04, infinite loop & crashes in case of identical argv2 and argv3 also don't forget to remove non-used imports "
"huaydin","Looks fine to me, all the exercises are made by example of the subject. I like that we go into c++ with easy examples and dont jump straight into big programms. Maybe in one of the exercises you could write some extra message for some cases, but it is not mandatory so it is ok !!"
"huaydin","Nice chat as always with Huseyin. A bit different approach to this exercises than me and i find this very nice that you can show a different thinking when they are different possibilities of doing the c++ projects. Good job man!!"
"huaydin","Great work! Phonebook worked perfekt!"
"huaydin","Unfortunately, there was a segfault after entering the 9th contact. After entering 8 contacts the index turns to 0 and the 8th contact is not saved. Instead of dark secret the phone number is printed."
"huaydin","Good job! sadly we found some small mistakes, but already found the fixes. - good luck with your next evals :)  "
"huaydin","Great work, very good explanation of the project, NO LEAK , NO CRASH.
 Keep up the good work and good luck. "
"huaydin","Overall a very nice project. They implemented many tricky solutions. In the go crazy part a new line was missing when exiting with CTRL-C after cat | cat | ls. And $""USER"" gave slightly different output than bash. Other than that everything worked fine, no leaks other than readline and no crashes at  any time of testing."
"huaydin","Everything works correctly, no crashes, no seg. faults etc. We have checked a lot of extreme cases and the outputs are good. Very deep understanding of the topic, logic, working of the bash. It's very easy to understand the code. Great job, congratulations!"
"huaydin","Unfortunately the signature.txt was missing. So sorry for that"
"huaydin","Better next time"
"huaydin","Usually, Husseyin is very careful but this time we found unfortunately there was 1 norm error. The rest seems fine"
"huaydin","Thank you for the amazing push_swap code. I see you have really put a lot of effort into it. You have even optimized the radix sort. Love it. Keep it up this way!"
"huaydin","tested manually for different input cases and some input did not work"
"huaydin","Super super cool. I really liked your Makefile and the way you optimized the raddix is also very great. Simple, very well done :)"
"huaydin","Wow i didn't know those stuff. Thanks for presentation and explanation. Cheers!!"
"huaydin","We tested a lot, went through the whole code several times and the code was very good explained. Because at the beginning was hard for me to understand but then i started to understand thanks to the good explanation. Good job man !!!"
"huaydin","Very interesting project. For the first time I have experienced a program that need to run simultaneously. We checked with Norminette and valgrind with and without --tool hellgrind and the program worked as expected. In this revision he removed extra files from the repository. "
"huaydin","we really had a long discussion over the project. he knows his code and project well. show me how to do the testing, showed me the flow of code and talk about different functions used in project. so wish you best of luck . "
"huaydin","Very interesting project. For the first time I have experienced a program that need to run simultaneously.  We checked with Norminette and  valgrind  with  and without --tool hellgrind and the program worked as expected. The only unfortunate thing is that he send older files too. But those files were not in the expected directory philo it doesn't affect the result of the code. "
"huaydin","In the revised version he added bonus parts. In particular, he checked existence of path to terminate the game; added ""enemies"" that blink at every third iteration and counter on the screen uying mlx_string_put. The process of manipulating with the images is indirect. In the sense that he first creates xpm image and puts it into a winwod. All the windows later destryoed and associated structure elements are freed.  "
"huaydin","Great work. Really funny textures 👍 good luck"
"huaydin","Everything worked. Code was explained in great detail. Clearly took his time to understand the documentation of minilibx. Even has an Event check if the User uses Linux or Apple. Map valitity worked on every test no leaks. GJ -- Keep it up!"
"huaydin","The sprites and the game itself looks really nice, sadly it isn't checked if there is a valid path from the player to the exit."
"huaydin","He was able to explain the basic concept of the task well. The code is still a bit too difficult for me. We have tested some things and unfortunately the valid-path check is missing. otherwise cool project, well done!"
"huaydin","Thanks a lot for explaining to me. The game is nice and efficient. We checked all the possible errors and leaks. Everything is working perfectly and explained well. Great job !!!"
"huaydin","Very nice job, thanks for explaining heredoc. Everything works as expected, outstanding."
"huaydin","very well done, pipes are very clean, loved the project :))"
"huaydin","This was most technical project I have seen so far. Although, we discussed  about one hour and half, it was fun  to test all those commands. We tested all the required point in the manual and everything seems to work as expected. So, I only have to Thanks for the detailed explanation and wish  Good luck for the next project.  "
"huaydin","You did well and had a well structure as well as clean code. Outstanding project!! all the best"
"huaydin","Explained his whole thought process flawlessly to the tiniest detail, wow! Keep it up and good luck! :)"
"huaydin","Great job and explanation.  To sort he uses improved (where he sorts both stacks a,b) radix algorithm. For 100  numbers it takes approx. 850 operations, for 500 it takes  aprox. 5700 operations which is slightly below excellent grade. Error handling looks fine  in this revised version he fixed an error from previous one, where he had a problem with MAX_INT +1. "
"huaydin","We checked the code thoroughly! He explained radix sort very well, and has a very good understanding how his program works. Just a small error: not checking for over MAX_INT which was a design problem of the index function. We discussed possible solutions!"
"huaydin","Very nice eval, could explain every aspect of the code and I love how structured the code, all the best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!180!"

"huaydin","You seem to know your stuff, could explain it well. Good job :) "
"huaydin","Good Job! Keep Going^^"
"huaydin","We went through all the functions. He divided everything into two C files and made everything very clear. We ran several tests and he explained everything to me very well. We went over his project again with two testers at the end and everything seemed OK there as well. His project looks very clean and structured to me. He explains everything very clearly and understandably. Keep up the good work. Good luck!"
"huaydin","Remarkable code, very efficient and neat, only two files used, showed deep understanding of functionality and C in general, impressive work! Loved the exchange"

"huaydin","Clear very deep explanation for all questions. Very great job! Good luck!"
"huaydin","Very kind and friendly and he explained a lot thank you !!!!"
"huaydin","core part looks very well done :) especially very impressed with trim!! :) he didnt do bonus, but we talked a bit about lists, i showed my work just to explain the core concepts :)) gl "
"huaydin","Very good code, check for ft_atoi behaviour over max long long but it should pass Moulinette. Good luck! :)"
"huaydin","Nice work! Bonus part sadly missing. Keep Going^^"
"huaydin","good work! fixed small mistake "

"hzunic","I decided to not fail the project because of the blackhole deadline, however I would recommend you to really look into bash scripting again as it is very important and useful knowledge to have.
 Besides the script explanation everything seemed to be well understood
 Good luck with the next projects!🐝"
"hzunic","Everything works, I've checked thoroughly due to the eval sheet. The peer knows all commands and can implement all subject requests.

"ischmutz","Great job, good explains, the team worked together :D

 Unfortunately, there is some little problems:
 - When we have by example 100 or 100000, we have a dict error
 - External functions calls like read and open are not protected and it can produce an infinite loop in some cases

 Except that everything is fine!

 PS: You could only use 1 open and not 2, you could also put your error messages on the 2nd output (STDERR), doing a .PHONY in your makefile

 Good luck for the rest of the piscine and for the final exam! 🌻

"ishvaiko","Great project, used a sort that I haven't heard about before and it seems to be impressively optimized, 500 integers under 5000 moves is something I haven't seen before."

"ishvaiko","very good project with the bonus. good  approach. thanks for the good explanation of the code! see you around! :)"
"ishvaiko","Well done, really well implemented handshake approach. Code is really fast, works as intended. For 10000 characters 0.02s only, thats insane. The only small issue that we found is that overflow checker is missed, other than that - outstanding!"

"ishvaiko","Good job doing all your functions! I would still recommend you to fix some of the errors that francinette shows you with the strict version, because you might need those functions later on in your curriculum. Also check out the bonus functions at one point, because they can also be help for later projects and the exam. Otherwise, I wish you a lot of fun and good luck with the rest of the evaluations and projects. See you next time! :)"

"ishvaiko","good job!"
"ishvaiko","well done, team worked great, eval was very nice, everyone knew what they were doing, sadly there was a error handling mistake when checking columns for 0 or neg integers :( dont worry about it, showing up and doing the work is 90% of the battle won <3"
"ishvaiko","Great Work. Some of the codes uncommon to what other students did, but tests did work. Could explain everything well."
"ishvaiko","thanks for explaining and teaching me"

"ishvaiko","good work "
"jbagomed","good job, all testing passt as per sheet, good luck "
"jbagomed","I tested every thing the eval sheet asked and couldn't find any errors. He explained me the code very well. Good luck with the next evaluation."
"jbagomed","Everything looks good. No memory leeks, no seg fault, sorting all cases fast enough for best grade. We tested for every case multiple random values and  also invalid numbers or arguments. Good luck."
"jbagomed","excellent work, thanks for the advice. Good knowledge of this project indeed. And as per sheet everything is just fine."
"jbagomed","Nice project! The server receives the prompt as a whole and then prints it. Good luck for your other evals!"
"jbagomed","well done!"
"jbagomed","project look great, we check for invalid maps and all other requirements . Jusup explained the code in detail. Thank you"
"jbagomed","Good job! The game looks nice, no unexpected behaviour nor leakages detected. The program passes all tests tried. When asked he could explain his code. Good luck for the next ones!"
"jbagomed","Great job! The project looks really good, I did not find any mistakes or problems in the code. He fixed the memory leak from the last evaluation and was able to explain his code with ease. Good luck for the upcoming evals and projects :)"
"jbagomed","We found some unprotected mallocs server side (some crash and one prints (null) instead of an error message).
 We also found some uninitialized values which could lead to undefined behavior if unlucky, we went over how to fix it.
 Other than that everything looks good & leak free!
 GL & hit me up on discord if you need to farm points :)"
"jbagomed","Everything works stable. Good clean code. Thanks!"
"jbagomed","Project is good. Runs as it should. All the tests I did worked. Checked the errors from the last time. Everything as it should be.  Discussed a few implementations how he could improve his minitalk. Good luck for the next evals."
"jbagomed","Very nice project, i really like that you can move through exit (so it is not considered a wall), and the counter from bonus is also implemented. Code is clean and works well. Unfortunately we found a leak in case of an invalid map, which is coming from get_next_line. Sorry for this and better luck next time."
"jbagomed","Unfortunately some points were not correctly implemented:
 * needs to compile with cc
 * Makefile shall recompile when src files were changed, the rule regarding this should be revisited
 * messages containing several newlines break the server as he doesn't respond anymore afterwards, seems that he is caught in an infinite loop"
"jbagomed","1) gcc instead cc 2) make didnt compile again when files were changed 3) when message had new lines, server couldnt print and after that server didnt print normal messages 4) check if getpid fails also check if pid is in valid range (at least not negative or 0 or 1)"
"jbagomed","Everything seems perfectly good, plus no globals were used."
"jbagomed","good code ,but  he send the msg  in char and not as a String."
"jbagomed","good job, he unerstand his code well, good luck with next project::"
"jbagomed","its working good, we check for all possible scenario  with all possible buffer size, and the code was working. He explained the code in detail . good luck for next evaluation."
"jbagomed","Good job !"
"jbagomed","This is now your fourth evaluation for this submission for ft_printf and I have to say, it is very well done. The minor thing that can be changed: The error handling will return (0) instead of the original (-1). As the program still exits the program and apart from that error is handled like it should, this is a passing grade for me!  Also as moulinette also already gave you its blessing, I see no other problems with it as well :) Keep up the good work and good luck with get_next_line! >w<"
"jbagomed","Mistake corrected. All OK."
"jbagomed","The code looks good and the problem for the last evaluation seems to be solved now, good luck!"
"jbagomed","The code worked except for the %p  test case if its NULL. Try to fix the mistake. Other  than that...the explanation was good. Good luck."
"jbagomed","unfortunately couln't explain the monitoring script, the rest was fine. Just make sure that you understand the code the you are using for the next time"
"jbagomed","Very good work! explained everything to me. We checked all the steps form evaluating subject! Good luck!"
"jbagomed","gut erklärung
 signature.txt OK
 added user and groups
 Script monitoring jede 10 min
 alles Ok  "
"jbagomed","The .txt file doesn't have the Signature."
"jbagomed","Вери кул. Все работает:)"
"jbagomed","Everything seems to work fine, all the previous problems seem fixed. explained what was wrong and why. Hold fast to dreams
 For if dreams die
 Life is a broken-winged bird
 That cannot fly.

 Hold fast to dreams
 For when dreams go
 Life is a barren field
 Frozen with snow.
 good luck on the next projects!!! +*"

"jbagomed","nice guy, explained everything to me, he knows what he is talking about"
"jbagomed","good work "
"jbagomed","comunicative and did a great job"
"jbagomed","everything fine :)"
"jbagomed","very well done, everything looks fine and he can explain everything well. Good luck with the rest of piscine:)"
"jbagomed","Good evaluation, he knew what the codes were about, just a few errors here and there, but he already knows how to solve these problems."
"jbagomed","Great work, only exercise 8 returned a small error"
"jhotchki","That is insane this man is crazy, this implementation goes very deep and way out of scope for this project, GG I am waiting for your event in the summit room!!"
"jhotchki","Great project, did a lot more than was ever ask. Chaos game is incredible interesting, complex and fun. We found some beautiful shapes. Best version of fractol i have seen so far. :))))"
"jhotchki","very very nice work, thank you for the explaination, the projekt seems very cool"
"jhotchki","the code works good especially the color render and zoom in and zoom out part. But the make file has a small problem. good luck."
"jhotchki","Everything works as it should and he also implemented a lot of nice colored messages which makes the progamms more fun to use. In total really nice project. Good job!"
"jhotchki","Fixed his issue with the PID 0, put a lot of effort in the server side with outputting, could explain everything in detail, well done, good luck for the other evals"
"jhotchki","Comprehensive project, thank you for the detailed explanations."
"jhotchki","unfortunately endless loop with pid 0 :( otherwise very nice project"
"jhotchki","Everything seems fine. There is no interruption in sending characters. With huge amount of unicode chars after sending them in a row there is some interruption but that is out of scope of this project. Great graphic design for this project that is why I gave outstanding it's amazing!"
"jhotchki","Outstanding project! Jesse has done all the parts of the project and much more that was not even asked for like visual formatting with lots of fancy colors which make the applications look like a proper chat program. The error handling is very thorough with distinct messages for all kinds of scenarios (especially the ""server is busy"" msg impressed me).
 He clearly knows the code from A to Z as he was able to explain to me in detail every nuance of it. Thank you for showing me your project! :)"
"jhotchki","unfortunately the printf folder was copied wrong so it was empty => dont include git repos in another git repos => delete .git folder. Good luck next submission!"
"jhotchki","Really good explanation of the code and how everything works , really good job good luck for the future :)"
"jhotchki","very friendly and nice. Thank you very much for your presentation. This is awesome. This is the best push_swap I have seen so far. Incredible low numbers. Great work! OUTSTANDING FOR SURE! Keep it up! Thank you!"
"jhotchki","Jaw dropped. This work is ORIGINAL, PERSONAL, all problems tackled from scratch. Thanks for all the patience explaining it, I think I've never enjoyed an evaluation so much. Happy to overlap with you here."
"jhotchki","Great project, nice explanation, outstanding sorting algorithm, the fastest I've seen so far. :)"
"jhotchki","Very detailed explanation on everything! Outstanding job!"
"jhotchki","Good work. You explained everything very well. Nice job and good luck :)"
"jhotchki","Did a really good job on explaining the purpose of VM's, the bonus part was indeed interesting and done carefully. Keep up the good work, greets."

"jhotchki","All tests OK, everything checked out, bonus compiled too. Great job!"
"jhotchki","Great project! Best get_next_line ever. Stunning!"
"jhotchki","Good job. Your code looks like it works.Try fixing the problem in the make file for fclean and clean but other than that good job. :)"
"jhotchki","Jesse made an extreme effort to make printf behave the same way as the original one and it's a really cool project. NULL as the format string segfaults but it's not clear if that's defined behaviour or required to implement. Fantastic job otherwise!"
"jhotchki","Awesome job, lot of work went in it it is visible. All the test passed"
"jhotchki","Very nice work! Allocated and freed everything really carefully. Could find any kind of leaks. Great job!"
"jhotchki","Great project."

"jhotchki","great job! bonus and everything works great! "
"jhotchki","Thank you very much for the proper explanations and your time for all of it. Code looked clean, you had some cool approaches to some functions and overall it seemed very clean and fine! Maybe just give cc a chance and look into the differences. I hope it won't lead to any issues. Good luck with your next projects and see you around! (:"
"jhotchki","Unfortunately repo contains files that were not supposed to be in it :( Good luck next time!"
"jhotchki","everything should be good and fixed his mistake on ex05 gl with moulinette now :)"
"jhotchki","You did great, good luck with Moulinette)) "
"jhotchki","well done hopefully this time you get it!"
"jhotchki","well done, i hop ex01 works, i will my code too
 "
"jhotchki","Missing 2 periods at the end of the line in ex01."
"jhotchki","great job, small mishap . sadface. period."

"jhotchki","This the best evaluateeee!!!!"
"jhotchki","Wonderful job! keep it going :)"
"jhotchki","All looks good!"
"jhotchki","They came up with a lot of different solutions in order to solve it, but couldn't code them during the short time that the rush gives. Anyway good approach. Take a look at malloc, free and also valgrind and llbd might be really useful. Good luck with the next projects!"
"jhotchki","really great explanations, gave me some new perspectives own my own code :)"
"jhotchki","Good job. Really good explanation. Good luck!"

"jhotchki","all looks good explained his code good. good luck."
"jhotchki","Great Work., Thank you for waiting for me for so long, I appreciate) Good Luck ))"
"jhotchki","Jesse was able to explain the changes he made and the issues he had, lovely as ever!"
"jhotchki","Very clean code and well explained!"
"jhotchki","clean creative code, good explainations"
"jhotchki","great guy, explained everything in detail, very polite would recommend"
"jhotchki","all looks good "
"jhotchki","Only one mistake, 3 insted of  2 bites."
"jhotchki","small mistake on ex05, otherwise all good"
"jhotchki","Good teamwork and good job with the code. Remember always to check the max int!
 Good luck for your next projects. ^_^"
"jhotchki","Good job, keep up the good work!"
"jhotchki","I won't be that asian guy"
"jhotchki","Norm mistake, easy next try. Good luck for your further projects."
"jhotchki","too many files in git"
"jhotchki","clear explanation about things i didn't know"
"jhotchki","Nice solutions. Great explation. Deep understanding of what you did.  GLGL"
"jhotchki","Nice Project! One simple mistake with the Date of the file, will be perfect on the retry! "
"jhotchki","just a small mistake in the 2nd exercise other then that everything looked fine. "
"jhuber","Passes all checks and everything works. Joel is a chill dude who explained his code well and implemented everything in a straightforward and concise way. have a great night!"
"jhuber","Hello,

 nice `so_long` but apparently it did not take you so long to write this project ;)

 Cannot say much against the code, everything is written clearly and easy to understand be proud!

 Checked (at least for me) every possibility with map errors.

 Have fun and good luck with your minitalk!"
"jhuber","He could explain his code very well, I didn't find any errors. Good luck with the next evals."
"jhuber","everything works fine, no memory leaks, all the error checks have been done correctly. Well done and gl"
"jhuber","Everything seems fine. Checked with huge amount of unicode chars he prints them in good time. Bonus was done. That's it. He was very nervous because he is waiting to eat pizza and beside that I was stressing him too much with my tests. Hope you enjoy pizza."
"jhuber","can't be blank"
"jhuber","Awesome project! fixed the small mistake from last time! Very well done, keep grinding!!!!"
"jhuber","Hey, your push swap works perfectly! Almost a perfect score, unfortunately sometimes it has over 5500 instructions for 500 numbers.

 The code itself is pretty clean, maybe just consider improving your filenames, for solo projects it's fine, but for group projects it might be challenging for the others.

 Else I wish you good luck for the next projects!"
"jhuber","Great job! Everything works as it should, he was able to explain what he did in his code. Good luck for the upcoming evals!"
"jhuber","Unfortunately didn't have the #ifndef in his .h file - otherwise the project looks really nice!!! "
"jhuber","Everything works as expected and in normal cases there is no issue. There are some missing protections that I couldn't solve. I assume intermediary functions' NULL returns doesn't let the other function know if it's memory allocation failed or not. It is worth to analyze that bits and update logic if necessary."
"jhuber","Very clean and good project:) Explanations were great and understandable!  keep going! make the bonus! GL WITH THE EXAM - I am sure u will do it ! "
"jhuber","Good explanations, thanks for taking the time to explain the code in detail."
"jhuber","good project, looks good also the password policy looks like it should, also user/hostname was like it should be, firewall was working, ssh was working as it should, i could not login as a root from outside :) good job"
"jhuber","Good work! he understands what is going on."
"jhuber","Everything works fine, jhuber could explain everything and did so in a very understandable way. could use the commands that were neceserry. also axplained what does what. Good job and good luck with the next projects!"
"jhuber","We went through the list and had an error in connecting with ssh. We tried to find the error,but everything seems okay. Still it did not work,unlucky "
"jhuber","Insane code, very epic. :P Clean code "
"jhuber","Alright! Printf works exactly as the built in printf. There was just a slight deviation when using ""%   %"" (spaces). but that should be no problem.
 Joel can explain everything perfectly and knows his code. Nice job! :)"
"jhuber","wen went through the code,looks good to me,passed francinette too."
"jhuber","Very clean code, I've seen all codes were working properly. Good luck for the next project."
"jhuber","Did rly good job! explained his code very well! keep going:)"
"jhuber","the project worked perfectly and everything was well explained :) hopefully moulinette will also be happy about your code"
"jhuber","Code should work! Malloc was not protected, but it should be fine for moulinette. Good job! "
"jhuber","perfect code"
"jhuber","Everything seems to be wroking well,, good luck witht he Moulienette"
"jhuber","good codes, good explanation in the last exercise. keep it up ."
"jhuber","good work and good luck"

"jhuber","Thank you for the explanation. Looks good!"
"jhuber","great work:)"
"jhuber","i feel so bad , just a wrong name of the function, other than that great code and nice guz."
"jhuber","Sorry for the 8, The rest seems to be good!"
"jhuber","Did a really good job on explaining his functions and understanding, keep it up!"
"jhuber","Code looks good to me!"
"jhuber","amazing job :D"
"jhuber","Good job, hopefully it all passes."
"jhuber","unfortunately empty git repository."
"jhuber","i'm sorry that the repo is empty. keep going!"
"jhuber","Didn't had time to finish the rush unfortunately

 Good luck with the rest of the piscinne!"
"jhuber","Awsome code!"
"jhuber","Good job :)"
"jhuber","Nice and neat!"
"jhuber","everyhing looks correct! very good work"
"jhuber","great work keep up perfect explantion :)"
"jhuber","great work, really prepared :)"
"jhuber","nice work :)
 sadly pushed a swap file, also didnt check for negative integers on y -  MAX int did work though :))

 talked a bit about argc, argv, and write funciton :))

 gl hf with piscine"
"jhuber","good work!"
"jhuber","Everything is correct and well explained. great job!"
"jhuber","everything works as it should :)"
"jhuber","everything works great ! "
"jhuber","Great work, obviously understands it very well."
"jhuber","Looks good! :)"
"jhuber","First evaluator already found mistake in the first task."
"jhuber","Very knowledgable, but a misunderstanding in the subject caused a problem."
"jhuber","outstanding work and a true 42 spirit. well done "
"jhuber","This guy is a shell master !"
"jhuber","He knows the material, and it looks he manage the material, sorry for the error!!"
"jhuber","Impressive work. Better to start next projects."
"jhuber","Joel was able to explain everything very clearly."
"jhuber","Everything went fine "
"jhuber","Went well"
"jhuber","ex08 incomplete and ex09 not done"
"jkatzenb","everything works fine , stress test of 15min was passed under 5 min. and we discuss a lot on networking and stuff. thanks and good luck for next project."
"jkatzenb","thank you for your explanation :) it was well done!"
"jkatzenb","wonderful execution! gio has honed their networking skills to mastery, I am impressed at the execution time of 4 minutes and 45 seconds. the rest of the time was spent explaining the networking processes in detail, gg"
"jkatzenb","Looks good! Sadly we had a crash :( We need to make sure that function returns are checked for NULL returns especially mlx_xpm stuff. Also watch out for strjoin! You can use a static variable for your big game struct, to eliminate the need for malloc. Also some hiccups in the parsing of the file -> watch out for atoi doing stuff you dont expect. In the end its small adjustments, you can do it! GL :D "
"jkatzenb","good work, code works well and no leak. explained everything they wrote, seams no problem to pass it."
"jkatzenb","Great stuff, they fixed their previous errors diligently, therefore the program now works just as expected. Really nice work, good luck with the other evaluations!!"
"jkatzenb","Nice work, but unfortunately we discovered several issues with the input checking:
 * deleting the line for ceiling/floor still starts the prog with a black colour
 * erroneous manipulation of any line and inserting an empty line afterwards triggers every time an ""empty line in map"" error as the parser interprets every line after the erroneous as part of the map
 * the identifiers can be appended with random chars and this is not verified
 * RGB colours are interpreted with atoi -> no value gives 0, chars after digits are still accepted"
"jkatzenb","Thank you for explaining everything to me about this project. I think everything is okay here good job"
"jkatzenb","Very cool and nice project explenation from him, I learned a lot of new stuff and actually, in my surprise, understood every single thing from it!"
"jkatzenb","Well done. Noticed some interesting behavior of c++ with inheritance. Good job and gl further! "
"jkatzenb","Excellent explanations of the code, everything seems to work fine - good luck :-)"
"jkatzenb","Great explanations of a completely new programming language for me. Unfortunately in the last exercise there was a wrong return for a point not being in side the triangle but it actually is. It only happens on the very edge of the triangle, like a point located at 0.499 , 0.499. Thank you for the patient explanations though, I very much appreciate the time."
"jkatzenb","Looks good. everything is working properly and he could explain everything perfectly. Good luck on the next eval and further projects :)"
"jkatzenb","very nice and friendly. Thank you for all the information and explanations. I really like your aliases for the make command. Thank you very much. Good work!"
"jkatzenb","Everything works fine, no errors and code works like specified in the subject. good job"
"jkatzenb","great job , clean code , good explainer, good luck with next project::"
"jkatzenb","Great work! The code looks very clean, they were able to explain everything very thoroughly to me. No valgrind errors, no segfault or similar and proper output. Good luck with the other evaluations!"
"jkatzenb","Great project:) Was awesome seeing c++ for the first time! Thanks for explaining to me, unfortunately had a few small mistakes:/ for sure u will fix it easily!  "
"jkatzenb","The code is clear, and well structured, everything is written in cpp manner as it supposed to be! The only problem we found during the evaluation, is the default value of atoi that is not handled in a proper way, otherwise - outstanding. Good luck with next modules!"
"jkatzenb","Thank you two for showing me your legacy project. You will be known for aeons. Young students will sit at the bonfire in what has been known as the basecamp to tell the tale of the fastest minishell in the West.\n
 \n
 \n
 Of course, we went through all the tasks, I had them explain to me all the details, and I went through the code, to see if I could catch some malloc protect errors :) none found!\n
 \n
 I wish you the best for the next projects, and of course, the exam.\n
 \0"
"jkatzenb","sehr gut erklärt, alles funktioniert, commands OK, echo, cat, unset, exit code, get grazy, Environment, variables, Pipes, cd, signal handler ist alles OK"
"jkatzenb","Thank you guys, this eval helped me a lot with understanding this upcoming project.
 Everything looks good to me, did not manage to crash it or find leaks.
 I'll definitely come back to y'all when I have questions:)"
"jkatzenb","Very good! Very informative. I learned a lot. Cheers."
"jkatzenb","Schaut nach nem geilen Projekt aus, aber der Code hat mir ein wenig angst gemacht :D"
"jkatzenb","Very well explained and never struggled to quickly show what the code is doing. Best of luck!"
"jkatzenb","Sadly there was an error with only one philosopher - they could eat sometimes... except for that, it seemed very good and if the program isn't slowed down everything works perfectly. Good luck next time"
"jkatzenb","good work and great explanation , good luck!!"
"jkatzenb","Good job! nicely done. Keep Going ^-^"
"jkatzenb","The prog compiles correctly, error input is handled nicely and the algo has the potential to go even faster, keep on!"
"jkatzenb","Good Job!"
"jkatzenb","Great project, user could explain every part of the code upon request. Tested multiple cases, had some initial issues which are of unknown origin, but seems like it works perfectly fine overall. Good luck!"
"jkatzenb","Gio is insane <3 !! cool project 🏩🏩🏩🏩🏩🏩🏩"
"jkatzenb","Server and client both work perfectly good job great code!
 "
"jkatzenb","Very nice project, did more than what was asked for in the mandatory part. Everything works as it should and there are now leaks. Good job!"
"jkatzenb","Really nice Project!!!! Thanks for your explanations and patience. Maps are really beautifull and the program has many features that were not mandatory!!! Great job!!!"
"jkatzenb","Very good! Nice execution of the project and nice colors :) Also nice to see your program running France and Japan test maps! All the best for the next evaluations!"
"jkatzenb","Everything works nicely and both bonuses were done too."

"jkatzenb","Well done! I had a great time discussing the project, GL with Moulinette and the makefile!"
"jkatzenb","well done project, could explain everything perfectly, good job! "
"jkatzenb","Very well structured code, everything looks good!"
"jkatzenb","good work whit the project and good luck whit mulinet"
"jkatzenb","Very interesting implementation by calling ft_printf itself recursively inside of subfunctions.... whoever needs to fix it in 10 years, have fun! But it works :D No flags tho...."
"jkatzenb","Good job, you're a rockstar to me!
 "
"jkatzenb","Perfect project, even did all of the bonus exercises. Good job!"
"jkatzenb","Very elegant code! Learned a great approach to strtrim with just a few lines of code. Handled edge cases like empty strings well! For ft_atoi: Make sure to have it behave exactly like the original atoi but I think it will pass Moulinette. Good luck!"
"jkatzenb","Gio did an amazing job! Explained their code extremely thoroughly, I was especially impressed by their solution for ft_strtrim. Good luck! "

"jkatzenb","Perfect. And very well explained! Thanks"
"jkatzenb","good explained and good job good luck with mol :)"
"jkatzenb","The code worked on another OS, but anyway the makefile relinked and there were some memory leaks that we discussed together.
 Next time compile it here :)
 BTW GG

"jkatzenb","Well done! gl !"
"jkatzenb","good explanations, good job!"
"jkatzenb","good work, only some edge cases might be problematic, but we dont  know"

"jkatzenb","Great talk! Was good to share your experience. So many valuable notions. Hope you have a good time in the last week of piscine! Good luck!"
"jkatzenb","Everything seems correct, sadly you compare an unsigned int with an int in ex01."
"jkatzenb","i hope u can get the ex10 right! good luck moulinette"
"jkatzenb","Good Job! Thnaks"
"jkatzenb","good work & ex08 is missing"
"jkatzenb","Code was fine and clean! answered all the questions I had. All in all it was a nice evaluation. Nice working with you :)!"
"jkatzenb","very clean code and good information! Very friendly & thank you for your time!!"
"jkatzenb","Solid work, missing ex08, I don't blame you. lol"
"jkatzenb","clean code and very nice work :) well done"
"jkatzenb","did good, still missing 8 lol <3"
"jkatzenb","Fast and fun! Repaired code looks nice"
"jkatzenb","good programs! we found some typos."
"jkatzenb","small mistake in ex02 but he recognized it immediately after seeing the code, ex03 unneccessary prototype which he also recognized himself, small mistake ex06 starting with -1, understood all the mistakes himself and the materials of the project, just some small mistakes"
"jkatzenb","The code is well written and clear to read. The team has shown deep understanding of the problem and managed to write good code, while using correctly the tools at their disposal. Next time remember about overflows and thanks a lot for your patience :)) Enjoy the piscine! 🏊 GLHF RTFM"
"jkatzenb","ya a good kid, but a few errors, ya can do it, my child <3"
"jkatzenb","Peer worked thoroughly through the tasks given, but has to check their backups more carefully. "
"jkatzenb","nice guy"
"jkatzenb","a few minor mistakes :) better luck next time"
"jkhasiza","Really cool pipex, sorry for accidentally creating 57 GB file on your PC & zombie processes & crashing it. Somewhat concerning situation but i decided to put OK. Pls dont start from cave next time it is annoying. Otherwise really cool project & great discussion, good luck with implementing more pipes handling & i also recommend heredoc, it is interesting subject."
"jkhasiza","Very well done! Especially the bonus part with the animations were worked out very well, Javid put a lot of work into that! Good luck!"
"jkhasiza","Nice project, we went trough all the cases, game looks good and animations are cool. He fixed previus errors. Good luck."
"jkhasiza","Very nice and interesting game))
 Looks very cool and has additional features. Good luck"
"jkhasiza","sadly there was the mistake that when you created a file. it created a file with mode 777 instead of 644. other than that good work. should be an easy fix. found no errors other than that. sorry for the fail :)"
"jkhasiza","marko already found a lot of issues. i wasn't able to find more. i think after u fixed the bugs the game is gonna be rly cool! u have nice features implemented, like the attack animation that even takes 2 tiles. "
"jkhasiza","I'm very happy to saw your project and code. It's very interesting how to optimize the drawing to only draw the things that change but the other part remain the same.
 Also, it's very impressive the attack and all the effort you put into the project.
 Here's a list of the errors/isues we found together:
 1. Norminette error in your main
 2. You could check the screen size with mlx function mlx_get_screen_size
 3. Remeber to write the errors in STD_ERR
 5. Check this: ./so_long maps/invalid_exit_not_reachable.ber
 Since the exit is not getting printed
 6. Remember to implement ""x"" for closing the window
 8. Run ""scan-build-12 make re"" so check for the bugs. If you like, you can implement the checks for asset.c and tile.c. And you libft functions (ft_int_arrcpy, ft_itoa)
 9. Remember to also print the ""last"" move to the exit."
"jkhasiza","Such a nice and cool aproach of the project, keep up with the good work and good luck!"
"jkhasiza","Great job! Everthing checked out! We went through the sheet and I tested all of it and for memory leaks. Took a look the the method too,very well explained keep it up!"
"jkhasiza","Excellent implementation of turk algorithim with clear explanation and understanding of the logic, good use of double operation and wisely avoids useless swap operations. awesome scores for both 100 and 500 well below expected limits. the evaluation is over but the memories will last a lifetime."
"jkhasiza","Great algorithm, you will rock when you fix the small shenanigans.

 Should be valid:
 ./push_swap ""3"" ""4""  ""   -00000012""
 free after there are duplicates
 don't sort if sorted! :-)"
"jkhasiza","Memory leak when there are duplicate numbers. Forgot to check ""already sorted inputs"". Otherwise great performance and great coding skills."
"jkhasiza","Unfortunatelly there were some leaks, but they're fixed now so good luck on the next one! Overall great work! :)"
"jkhasiza","Good work, as expected! Framework performed according to the specifications, was well and compactly written and the tests made sense. Looks useful for the future!"
"jkhasiza","Hey, the Rush looks good. Everything is appearing to work and the tester is actually forking, what a surprise.

 The code is short and concise, so not much wrong to do. I guess Minishell helps a lot there.

 But come on at least you could have added some colors, or more signals for a few bonus points (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻"
"jkhasiza","Norme:c eval still took 1h lol VERY GOOD WORK"
"jkhasiza","very nice and friendly. you answered all the questions correctly. your virtual machine works as expected. you know what you are doing. Thank you and good luck for the exam. ;)"
"jkhasiza","Great work, great understading. Good luck in future endevours!"
"jkhasiza","Thank you for help me remember the knowledge, good luck!"
"jkhasiza","great work, also good idea to implement structs. well done"
"jkhasiza","Also a great project! explained everything perfectly like his printf! great guy:) keep going! (didnt find any mistakes)"
"jkhasiza","Did a great job on this project:) was done a little complicated but in his own way which is awesome! Did some testing but everyting works as it should!"
"jkhasiza","As I said before, very well written code. One can clearly see that you put a lot of thought behind the process. I appreciated your transperency and the discussion we had. Thank you  "
"jkhasiza","very nice and friendly. I really like your approach to that program. It is very different than all the others I have seen so far. Every test worked as it should. Thank you for the interesting discussion."
"jkhasiza","All tests passed, congratulations!"
"jkhasiza","Good job, code valground without memleaks, huge files and various buffers also worked out. Shame that moulinette will eat it because of the read size when checking for invalid file descriptor... but next time is gonna pass for sure!"
"jkhasiza","The code is clear, and well protected. The student is able to explain everything very thorough, but unfortunately the read function uses a wrong number for reading:( I am sure you will manage it soon, good luck with it! "
"jkhasiza","I|m so sad that you included the extra file :(  Your code is good, and I'm sad to fail you because that silly mistake. Well, hope you regain your evaluations point soon and submit again your code. Good luck and see you around bro! :)"
"jkhasiza","Great work! Just a norm error unfortunately"
"jkhasiza","unfortunately there is a Norme error in ft_printf.c and an .md file in the GIT repository.
 We checked the functionality of the printf anyway and everything was working as expected.
 Good luck with the next evaluation!"
"jkhasiza","Really good project, everything explained in detail and cleared a lot of questions for me. Thank you!"
"jkhasiza","Great work, tester passed, no leaks, malloc protected indeed. Good luck further on!:)"

"jkhasiza","everything seems fine, hope bullynette is as nice as you are <33"
"jkhasiza","great. Good luck!"
"jkhasiza","Good job! "
"jkhasiza","This was really good work! Handling of leaks is very good. So the only problem was that invalid maps were not handled. The different combinations offer correct results."
"jkhasiza","Program works well with valid inputs, but sadly not all errors were taken into account"
"jkhasiza","i was perplex by the complexity of their code and how good thei could explain exverzthing and als answered to all mz questions! Wonderful!"
"jkhasiza","passed all tests, elaborate test cases, good understanding of the subject matter, but crazy keyboard ;)"
"jkhasiza","Impressive work !! and great explanations. good luck. "
"jkhasiza","Good work. Malloc not protected. Makefile re link. Emty sting print zero. The open is protected. Prints error when file is not there. You can change the input file. It will check for error in the input file. Error handling works fine . Protected from to big numbers above max int. nice try keep it up :)"
"jkhasiza","good work! "
"jkhasiza","great work, keep going on"
"jkhasiza","Git repository is empty..."
"jkhasiza","you pushed false project! but thank you for your explanation"
"jkhasiza","Normminete is not happy. Code is clean and easily understandable. Good job. "
"jkhasiza","exercise 2 does not work with norm. unfortunately. thanks anyways for explanations"
"jkhasiza","good work, keep it up. The code looked really structured to me. They used malloc, but forgot to make a malloc protraction and had 1 memory leak. Hope you learned something new and  have fun, good luck gg :)"
"jkhasiza","Great Work, nice to MEET YOU"
"jkhasiza","Impressive work."
"jkhasiza","All solutions are very original and well understood! A++"
"jkhasiza","Great job man! nice coding. I learned a lot from this. Good luck with the other questions when you solve them; and with Moulinette. See you around bro"
"jkhasiza","polite"
"jkhasiza","Great work, he showed deeper understanding of the code =)"
"jkhasiza","good work. sadly it endless loops with MAX_INT. Error handling also works. Keep it up :)"
"jkhasiza","Didn't find any errors - very well done! :)"
"jkhasiza","Looks great!"
"jkhasiza","Everything works fine and nothing suspicious. Keep it up!"
"jkhasiza","great job keep it up<33333333"

"jkhasiza","Nice work!"
"jkhasiza","Great  job "
"jkhasiza","A a small oversight in exercise 5 don't allow me to validate ex6, ex07 which are OK. Completely understand the project."
"jkhasiza","great job! ex08 missing"
"jkhasiza","everything was ok."
"jkhasiza","Wow.... what a piece of code! I really like the way you code man, and how you use the commands, and apply new stuff. I learnt a lot with you and seeing this code. Good job bruh! Keep it rollin'    : D  100%"
"jkhasiza","Looks great! Check ex06, ex08, ex09 again."
"jkhasiza","ex01: fix content size"
"jkhasiza","ex01: remove the original file, change timestamps and make the file size 40
 ex02: change timestamps and fix the file sizes
 ex07: remove the other files
 ex09: missing
 "
"jklocker","I am very happy to have Jakob in my team. Thats why we also will continue our work together. "
"jklocker","great work :) we tested everything and they explained their work to me. gg"
"jklocker","Project well explained, answered all of my questions. Website is responsible also during the game.
 Back and forth button does not work through the log in, u have to click for the login again (more secure i guess).
 Beautiful fronted. 👍 "
"jklocker","Well that's way better than the first time, most of the things that were not working correctly last time have been fixed, some concepts that you used last time like heartbeat disapeared, frontend is way more responsive (even if i'm not that fan of the colour)

 Still some minors problems in some edge cases but I'm sure that it will be fixed later :)
 Good job and GG for the end of the cc! have fun in internship or anything else "
"jklocker","- ip and client_id are hardcored in frontend/environnements/environnements.ts
 - game and website in general are not responsive
 - chat don't instantly update when a new user join, the old messages are not present here
 - during game disconnect, second user is in a weird state and is still considered as INGAME
 - invite via chat is putting the user ingame, without any real match request
 - when you block someone if you don't reload the page, you can still see the new messages
 - you should close your db port from the outside

 Good luck for fixing these things"
"jklocker","good work, but some stuff was missing."
"jklocker","He wanted to eval the bonus but forgot to push the repo"
"jklocker","thanks for taking so much time to explain every little details. I could tell that you really understood everything your where doing. Good luck with the last project ! :)"

"jklocker","Explained the project very well and went through every file and showed me everything and more what was asked for in the subject. Cool project and good luck!"
"jklocker","really nice Code.
 They could explain everything what they did!
 They really took the time to explain me everything in Detail and showed me what its all about
 thanks for your time :)"
"jklocker","awesome project and super understandable explanations. thanks for taking so much time to answer all of mz questions and good luck with the next project!"
"jklocker","really nice executed the project - you can tell they really know what they are doing - also nicely explained the code - also we found out that 'nc' doesnt like double 'CTRL-D' and cannot send anything after that but we checked in Wireshark and the Server handles everything accordingly - Good luck! "
"jklocker","Jakob ist lieber Mensch der sehr gut coden kann, yeah! Nice Project, was nice to see the possibilities of templates and a bit sad that i cant used it while i still have to code in C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111!!1"
"jklocker","Very good work and excellent explanations. Learned a lot of new things, mainly about different containers and when to use them. Code looked fine to me as far as I can tell, and he seemed like he knew everywhere what's going on. The programs were tested and I was happy with their performance. Thank you for the exchange and good luck for the next one!"
"jklocker","finally he fixed his error handling, was very poor last weak :p good job >) thank you for the explanation "
"jklocker","Pech gehabt "
"jklocker","He already knew that he failed the project due to a too strict error handling regarding the cvs values, but yet he agreed to go through it again for me. It's nice to have such a peer."
"jklocker","Looks very nice! Sadly one check was too rigorous. Should be easy fix!"
"jklocker","By far the most immersive game world I have ever witnessed. As if ""Cooking Mama 2"" for the Nintendo DS™ and ""Death Stranding"" had an illegitimate child. 4.83/5.
 -IGN"
"jklocker","it was a pleasure getting lost in the moss green fields of immanuels and jakobs cub3d the bright blue sky and the healthy grass green floor made me enjoy life again, it was like going for a walk on a fresh and sunny fall morning in the middle of the scottish highlands surrounded by old walls covered with moss. the air blew through my hair and the sound of the nearby waterfall was like music to my ears. thank you for this experience !"
"jklocker","Amazing project. Great understanding of the code. Happy Coding :)"
"jklocker","He was able to explain it very clearly and did solve the level really fast. Good Job! Keep Going^^"

"jklocker","Good job! nice explanation. Keep Going!^^"
"jklocker","Code  workds as expected, he explained everything, i checked for memory-leaks, passed all the tests .Good Job. to end this Feedback, a short poem.

 In Module 07 we learn of C++,
 Pointers and arrays, it's not a fluke.
 Dynamic memory and functions too,
 Templates and STL, oh what a view.

 We delve into classes and objects galore,
 Encapsulation and inheritance we explore.
 Polymorphism and virtual functions,
 Abstraction and interfaces, their junctions.

 Header files and namespaces we employ,
 Exceptions and error handling we deploy.
 From OOP concepts to advanced features,
 Module 07 is a treasure of C++ treasures. "

"jklocker","Very nice work. Peer knows his code very well and can explain everything.
 Here is some random stuff:
  An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke. The use of the word esoteric distinguishes them from languages that working developers use to write software. The creators of most esolangs do not intend them to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, such as visuospatial syntax, have inspired practical applications in the arts. Such languages are often popular among hackers and hobbyists.
 Good luck with Moulinette"

"jklocker","I really enjoied this evaluation,
 The team was really friendly and enthusiastic about what they did, they even prepared a powerpoint to explain everything they wrote.
 They were really prepared and evidently they worked together at the project.
 The code was clean and understandable,(it could be better but it was comprehensible and the functions name was kinda self explanatory)
 god_check GG.

"jseidere","Everything works as intended, no leaks, no errors. Nice"
"jseidere","A bitter fact to accept, his radix actually sorts 50~ moves more effecient with 100 numbers than mine. Accepting the loss it is worth meaning that the project structure is built really well and includes smart solutions for freeing and exiting the project at certain points. Approving this leak-free and well protected, congrats ;)"

"kbrauer","This time everything is working well. Wish you the best in the other evls, "
"kbrauer","Unfortunately there was a data race in case of 1 philo, otherwise everything seemed to work fine. Good luck next time."
"kbrauer","Great Project, unfortunately his philo died when I tested it with more then 100. Good luck next time"
"kbrauer","the program was working really good, just one small mistake with the arguments .""/philo 1 800 400 805464564564648854667 3 "" that was an overflow. I wish you luck. "
"kbrauer","Nice work!
 We checked all the cases and there are no leaks or other unwanted behavior. The code is clean and easy to understand. Argument validation is also rock solid. Good luck with next :)"
"kbrauer","Except for transmitting unicode characters everything works according to the evaluation sheet! Explanations were on point! GOOD JOB !!!"
"kbrauer","Good implementation, used sigaction is a good way to handle signals. Server prints message without interruption. GL."
"kbrauer","Everything seems in order, code looks fine and bonus part functions as intended very nice work."
"kbrauer","Ft_printf folder in the repo was unfortunately empty."
"kbrauer","What an explanation, everything looks nice a lot of functions but he knows his stuff, good luck on your journey! "
"kbrauer","Nice project (especially explanation of the code). Unfortunately it cannot handle empty string as input. Max and min int are also not checked adequately. Errors should be displayed on standard error. Otherwise you got nice scores! Better luck next time."
"kbrauer","Code seems correct, Kevin can explain exactly how it works. Interesting algorithm. Keep it up!"
"kbrauer","very nice and friendly. from philanthropist to treasure hunter I can say that this is always a fun project to evaluate. Your code is very readable and your explanations were clear. Nice sprites, nice design and I won all of the games. Good work!"
"kbrauer","Well structured code and really solid. All of the functions are protected, and all my tests are passed. I really like implementation of the extra features like mouse clicks and mouse wheel for movements. Also really cool animation, I like it:)"
"kbrauer","I liked a lot your project. It was super fun, the graphics and the moved. and also the string printing was very well done. Congrats!

 Have provided feedback on how to correct this."
"kbrauer","He was well prepared!"
"kbrauer","Some additional files were committed. Otherwise ok."
"kmoraga","Good job, everything have been correctly explained and the code is clean :)
 Just be careful about your error messages sometimes, and you also have some parts repetitive in your code that you could remove.

 Excecpt that it's fine! Good job!"
"kmoraga","thanks for the thorough explanation, helped me a lot, and good luck for the next ones! :)"
"kmoraga","Reallyyyyy cool!! Explaind all and it looks perfect. :D"

"kmoraga","Understand the sorting alg. very well and handle all the memory issue! Good luck!"
"kmoraga","Very good explanation and understanding about the project. Pass all tests. Good job. Good luck."
"kmoraga","Did not protect every allocation of memory. If something was successfully allocated and then another one failed, the memory allocated before was not freed. Also does not throw an error with the following input: ""3 one 8"".

 Besides that, good project! Sorts the numbers correctly without too many instructions. Good luck!"
"kmoraga","unfortunatlly the malloc are not protected in all situations. But the code works well and all the error are handled and printed on the right output. The next push will be the good one! wish you luck"
"kmoraga","very well done project...have the better version but he just played safe. everything was working properly, did his memory allocation problem thorouhly...so best of luck :)"
"kmoraga","unfortunately it segfaulted when the malloc failed  (ulimit -v 2750 ; ./push_swap 32 5 12)
 he protected malloc, but the return from sub function to main function did not check if malloc failed"
"kmoraga","Clear and well-structured code, works very well. Good job!"

"kmoraga","Very good EVL, he explained all my questions. Good Luck!!"
"kmoraga","Great work, good luck on born2beroot! Also, did you know:
 Ketchup comes from asia where it used to be a soup for the poor. It was made from fish rests, but a man (family name ""Heinz"") from england liked it so much that he wanted to recreate it in his country. But instead of using fish, he used tomatoes as a base. And thats how our beloved ketchup was created. Great story, right. I wonder if ppl even read what im writing, r u? Tell me in the feedback!"
"kmoraga","Great work! Good luck with the exam.
 Also, did you know: Flamingoes are only pink because of chemicals called carotenoids in the algae and fish (which also eat the algae) they eat; their feathers are grayish white when they're born."
"kmoraga","very nice great work smart code "
"kmoraga","Great Job. Keep up the good work. also, fun fact: Wombats are the only animal whose poop is cube-shaped."

"kmoraga","ex02 and ex06 are missing."
"kmoraga","Thanks for your patience and the feedbacks  "
"ldulling","Great project! Almost perfect minishell, sadly exit with large numeric does not display right error message, and wrong exit code. "
"ldulling","WOW! Amazing minishell, just small minor problems with exit exit aruments, but for me it's not reason to fail. Good luck!"
"ldulling","Great job! I'm absolutely amazed by this project. They explained everything with ease and helped me to understand their work. It's definitely the most impressive minishell I've seen so far. Unfortunately there was a small mistake in the exit part, but it shouldn't be too difficult to fix it. Good luck for the next evaluations, amazing work!!"
"ldulling","very nice and friendly. A_M_A_Z_I_N_G project. So beautiful fractals. Very readable code, very well explained. I like the amount of fractals - Multibrot, Multijulia, Barnsley-Fern. Soo beautiful. Thanky you very much! Good luck for the exam! ;)"

"ldulling","Awesome job with awesome colors! Ouhaaa"
"ldulling","thanks for the amazing evaluation, the explanation was very good and helped me learn a lot of stuff! everything is working fine! :) good luck and see u around!"
"ldulling","Great project, very nice way of handling the bit transmission. Lukas can explain everything in detail. "
"ldulling","Good job peer implement some fancy stuff with signals and how argument of PID works, i really like it. Good luck with next evaluation and next project's!"
"ldulling","Code looks good so far. Sending of the server is pretty fast < 0,01sec for 100 signs. Only problem is that the string is not malloced in the server. Please also check the 0 PID - i would suggest to forbid it. But I think that's a fast fix for Lukas. Also pretty structured and could explain his code very well. GL!"
"ldulling","Unfortunately the server prints garbage if confronted with a huge string. Next time is gonna pass for sure!"
"ldulling","I think the alg. perf. will be like O(n*logn) and it is quite fast!
 We discussed about how it could still get about 5%-10% more optimized by ss, rr, rrr operations, breakdown the question into string processing after the numbers are sorted."
"ldulling","well done! great explanation, very elaborated code, most impressive Makefile ive seen so far! GL see u soon "
"ldulling","Great guy, explained everything very good, great and clean code! Wish him all the best and hopefully I can evaluate him again :D great work!"
"ldulling","Very extensive code, thank you for taking the time to go through everything. Great implementation and understanding."
"ldulling","very nice and friendly peer. Great work. very quick. awesome that you have used linked lists. thanks for the interesting discussions like preparing for a project,... :) thank you very much for showing me your previous work. "
"ldulling","Very good implementation. Also quick in relation to a implementation with character arrays. Very good evaluation session. Learned new stuff. Thanks"
"ldulling","Wonderful work , interesting implementation of linked lists, great job!"
"ldulling","Well done! I see such a good implementation of get next line with linked lists for the first time, really well done! All my test cases are passed, even a couple of impossible ones, we have also discovered that 1024 is not the max number of possible opened file descriptors and we have discovered some weird behavior of static variables:)"
"ldulling","Code looks nice, everything works as expected. Nice to see a new approach with linked list instead of a char arr . Good job ! :) "
"ldulling","Great work! Worked with a struct in this project which makes it easier to save further information about the buffer etc. That was a great idea! The code looked very clean and is understandable. "
"ldulling","Awesome project, one of the few people to pass strict in francinette with also a fast and creative approach using linked list."
"ldulling","Very good written code! It is very efficient! good explanations and we had a nice chat about the project! was very impressed with the list approach! good job, keep going:) u will rock the exam!!!!!! "
"ldulling","Great explanation, bonus part looks very cooll!!"
"ldulling","Everything works well."
"ldulling","The evaluation was very well done. All the steps were explained thouroughly. Could do all the commands without checking any kind of script. Interesting bonus stuff also well executed! Good luck on the next prohects!"
"ldulling","SSH port forwarding was NOK, nice bonus implementation btw! Good luck next time!"
"ldulling","perfect!"
"ldulling","Truly a great implementation, I was especially impressed with his handling of invalid specifiers and the level of detail that went into handling these cases. Lukas thought of everything it seems. Simply awesome!"
"ldulling","You are incredibly patient! Congrats for this impressive work!"
"ldulling","code works all great, an amazing job i'm very impressed. Congrats!"
"ldulling","The code is clear, everything works in the best way. The performance of the code is really good, for easy file 0.138s, for medium file 0.622s and for hard one 0.914s, wow!. Guys have done really great job on thid project, keep it up!"
"ldulling","Ye, very good job, try to obfuscate the code for the favore of the norminette even more, i still can read it!"
"ldulling","Outstandingly written code, first guy who I saw who did the Bonus Part :) - Keep up the good work ;3"
"ldulling","Very polite and well explained. Makefile contains some interesting features. GL!"
"ldulling","The code looks great, good luck with moulinette."
"ldulling","Looks good. Hopefully will pass moulinette."
"ldulling","Great work, I like your code. Good luck with the exam."
"ldulling","Good job. Corrected the previous mistake."
"ldulling","did great! explained everything very well and knows how his code works. Wish you good luck and keep up the good progress :)"
"ldulling","Small compiler error in 00, otherwise good."
"ldulling","ex00 doesn't compile, everything else looks good. "
"ldulling","only one task to check, looks fine now "
"ldulling","Very nice code! Especially ex05, nice joob :)"
"ldulling","you put a lot of efforts in writing your own code - congratulation for that! because it was not easy. Check the Makefile and do not forget to check the norm manually. Also remember writting errors in the right file descriptor. Something that you also have to remember is to check in the man what the fonction you are using is returning on errors and if you should check the return value or not. I appreciated the discussion and your questions. I wish you good luck for the end of your piscine!"
"ldulling","nice creative code, well explained, tested all"
"ldulling","awesome. very pleasant personality. knows what he's doing. thanks."
"ldulling","knows his code very well. I'm super impressed by the solution of sqrt and is_prime. keep it up! "
"ldulling","Was great! Took the time to walk through the hole code. Learned alot!"
"ldulling","respect"
"ldulling","very nice work !!!"
"ldulling","in ex00 there was a small mistake with calculating the string length, other exercise where fine and worked perfectly! Great explanation also!"
"ldulling","good knowlog !!looks good .and a cool guy!! "
"ldulling","great work. Good luck with this machine."
"ldulling","very nice code, nice job +*"
"ldulling","Good code, unique approach."
"ldulling","Fixed his error, could explain me every detail, polite and friendly defense"
"ldulling","ex00: returns 0 when s2 is too short instead of the difference, friendly and polite defense"
"ldulling","had some easily fixable mistakes in the first two exercises. Good luck with the next evaluations."
"ldulling","nice code, well expained +*"
"ldulling","Lukas, thanks for explaining the ex10 and 11. Good Luck!!"
"ldulling","Very nice and clear code, great explanations, it was a pleasure. Thank you! :)"

"ldulling","Great code, good job. Good luck."
"ldulling","interesting approach and good work"
"ldulling","Great work done, good luck "
"ldulling","Really good work and really good explains, the parsing was good and the solving is perfectly working, good job!

 Unfortunately, mallocs were not protected and a crash can occured due to NULL pointer if an allocation fail

 Also, don't forget to free your elements in all the cases before exiting your program and also to put your error messages in the expected output (STDERR)

 Good job again and good luck for the rest of the piscine!"
"ldulling","Good work."
"ldulling","very good eva session! thanks for the inspo for ex08 ;) gl on your next projects!"

 Good luck for the rest of the piscine! Have a nice day :)"
"ldulling","Good code and good explanations!"
"ldulling","Everything seems fine. Good job! Thanks for the explanations."
"ldulling","Great explanations, Exercise 04 displays all MAC Adresses listed in system file address"
"ldulling","Great job and explanations, hope ex04 will work out even tho it solved in other way:)"
"ldulling","Looks fine - hope 06 works :) "
"ldulling","was good and helpful thank you !"
"ldulling","very good, the evil is in the details "
"lelsinge","Well, i tried my best. The only issue is that with bigger Zs(1000+) the scaling becomes way to distanced so you cannot see anything, otherwise everything works as expected, no leaks were found(funcheck + valgrind ) and the image is correctly rendered. Was pleasure trying to break it.Good luck! "
"lelsinge","All correctly formatted maps displayed without issue, errors were parsed correctly, no memory leaks detected. Good luck with the next eval!"
"lelsinge","Great code and good explanations, good luck with moulinette :) "
"lelsinge","Unfortunately, the program crushes on an empty file "
"lelsinge","He showed all the maps, explained well. Thank you!!"
"lelsinge","Great work and good explanation of the code, sadly the 4x4 matrix test did not work. Good luck next time :)"
"lelsinge","i like your quicksort solution, code looks very clean and provides good readability, good job 😄!"
"lelsinge","Very nicely done. Everything worked as it should. I tested with all the error cases I could think of. for the 100 numbers laurenz' algorithm was on average slower than 700 moves but somewhere around that mark usually. For 500 numbers it was always around the 5000 moves mark. every malloc was protected and there were no norm errors. overall solid project"
"lelsinge","I had a really interesting evaluation with Laurenz, he not only showed the program running smoothly but also answered questions like why not only quixk sort was used and the method behind the project. We also changed up the code to see if it changes the output. Thank you great work"
"lelsinge","works fine but a malloc was not protected."
"lelsinge","Printed not correct error message (made custom ones) and printed instructions when input is already sorted.
 Besides that I like the implementation of quicksort which also performs really good with a big input. Good luck with the next try!"
"lelsinge","I am sry make didn't work! :( Good luck next time!"
"lelsinge","Very cool project. We discussed his code and implementation. He was very patient with my questions, and was kind enough to answer them :D Noice!"
"lelsinge","Very nice work. Handshake as well as Unicode support for the bonus was implemented. The code was really great and the speed was lightning fast. Norminette also didn't complain. Definitely one of the best minitalks I have seen yet. Laurenz used one global Variable but could explain why it could not be avoided. Definitely deserves the outstanding project."
"lelsinge","Wonderful - interesting project, clean and readable. Thanks for the additional explanations, perhaps I could even re-write it by myself with what you've taught me. :D
 Perhaps someone else could come up with some arcane pattern of characters that'd actually break this project, but that someone ain't me - full marks from me!"
"lelsinge","des woar a guads projekt, des mi ua beindrukt hot. guade oabeit koleg! weita so, du zehnfoch multpiplizierta Programiera. leiwand. Möd di wennst Frogn host. "
"lelsinge","Great work, he knew his code very good and explained it very well to me. We tested with a few tester and everything good. NO LEAKS. Keep up th good work. :) "
"lelsinge","everything works well, no leaks, he freed what he malloced in a function. he used a function called ft_putnbr_base to print numbers in different bases. good solution and good job!"
"lelsinge","Quite impressive code, achieved to compress gnl into very few lines and functions - although at the cost of readability xD - almost everything done with pointers which also is rare. Good job!"
"lelsinge","great project!"
"lelsinge","Everything works as expected, bonus different files. Great job."
"lelsinge","All questions good answered. He thinks like programmer! Knows a lot about VM's good luck in future!
 Here is some random stuff: Debian (/ˈdɛbiən/), also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993. The first version of Debian (0.01) was released on September 15, 1993, and its first stable version (1.1) was released on June 17, 1996. The Debian Stable branch is the most popular edition for personal computers and servers. Debian is also the basis for many other distributions, most notably Ubuntu."
"lelsinge","gud fella. good series. this guy: gud guy. i asked him way too many questions to ensure that he is a genius. now i am 87% sure. very good projekt. i do not understand why he did not the bonus full. next time brother!"
"lelsinge","As he has a lot of experience with this kind of task, he could explain everything very well and make the modifications for the evaluation with ease. He was the first I evaluated to use CentOs and explained the differences very well as I understand it. For the bonus he did the partitions and set up a chat server. Very good project. I learned many new things"
"lelsinge","Really good project, could explain all the functions i had questions about. Didnt do the bonus"
"lelsinge","great code! could exlain it all :) asked questions about the description of the funtions and how they work. nice and short makefile ;) moulinette will be proud ! :D"
"lelsinge","Great Code. He explain every question about the function and how they Word. Great job!"
"lelsinge","I tested everything with my own tests and it seems to be working as it should. Some functions gave me new input and ideas so overall I think it looks very good!"
"lelsinge","Great work "
"lelsinge","Nicely done"
"lelsinge","Good Job, Good luck nd the exam "
"lelsinge","sorry :("
"lelsinge","very good thanks for explain "

"lelsinge","Great Job!"
"lelsinge","Explained perfectly. Well done."
"lelsinge","ok.. :)"
"lelsinge","overall good work. easy to read and understandable code. I think ex11 is not correct. Looks similar to my approach which was also incorrect. good job Laurenz :)"
"lelsinge","Nice work, sadly minor mistake at ex10"
"lelsinge","very cool implementation of ex11"
"lelsinge","/!\ mawijan doen't come to the evaluation or the week-end for work with her mates /!\
 Sorry, you don't have the time to finish your project but you was some good ideas and you are on the good way!"
"lelsinge","Very good work. No Bubblesort :(("
"lelsinge","all ok, except ex08"
"lelsinge","Great work:))"
"lelsinge","Thanks! :-))"
"lelsinge","You did a great job there, but there are a lot of littles errors:
 You're displaying newlines even if the columns are null or negative;
 The prototype of the rush function is not well formatted following the subject's rules;
 There is another work folder that wasn't asked  in the subject, watch out to keep your repository clean!
 And next, your code is really heavy, with a lot of && and || operators, a lot of if conditions... You could really increase your code quality and readability. Ask others some examples, it should be really usefull for you!
 Keep working, that's great! Good luck for the next three weeks!"
"lelsinge","for me there are to many pointers and arrays... but it seems to work ^^"
"lelsinge","so many arrays and pointers "
"lelsinge","I tried to make sure every detail is correct, and I think I should be 100 this time"
"lelsinge","Great student he knows to explain his code."
"lelsinge","ex01 - Remove new line from output
 ex04 - Use ifconfig instead of ip
 ex05 - Optional? Change the permissions
 ex06 - Display first, remove second line pattern
 ex07 - Remove the last new line
 Except for the mistake, there was an excellent understanding of the material and exercises."
"lelsinge","Very calming and clever. Explained his codes, so I could learn something too! :)"
"lelsinge","Flawless execution! Could explain what he did in each exercise and shared some tips and tricks :)
 Very nice guy! :D"

 "
"lilin","Good job, great explanation, clean code. Passed all the test from eval sheet, no leaks found with fsanitize. "
"lilin","Well done, Lilie has shown me the mistakes she had before and how she now protected some functions. The code is pretty clear and she was able to explain everything in detail and understandable even though I havent done the project yet.
 Thank you very much :)  "
"lilin","Program works fine and as required to the subject. When through the whole code base and explained her approach. Nice project. Good luck with next evals!"
"lilin","- make sure to protect thread creation
 - make sure that mutexes locked / unlocked in same order (not proven, make research, disporve mutex god, Marco (not me for sure))
 - philo.c line 31 -> don't unlock time.lock right away
 - Amount of mutexes per fork should be considered as well. You have multiple mutexes per fork.
 - Die time is late and it should be under 10ms

 * Rest works according to evaluation sheet."
"lilin","Thank you very much for explaining this project. I recalled C05 project evaluation from Piscine time. It is always pleasure to discusse something with you.  "

"lilin","Nice work, checked her mistakes from previous evals and Lili corrected everything. She even implemented animations which rendered really fast and used lots of colors."
"lilin","Fractals are well implemented, everything looks fine, but there are some minor mistakes:
 1. executable takes more than it requires: ./fractol mandelbrotfdsfds
 2. mlx_init and mlx_new_window are not protected
 3. norminette error in header file
 4. for julia in bonus it takes non valid numbers as well: ./fractol julia 0.3.3fdf-0.554hd 0.56.57.78.780
 Good luck with resubmitting :)"

"lknobloc","awesome clean code with detailed and clear explainations.! awesome job :3 gg"
"lknobloc","max nice = 1024. or was it file descriptors? probably both because Luca is and did amazing. Checked for all the cool buffer sizes and crazy files, her code managed it all. Lou Reed did great work there. Bonus also done to perfection (ever heard of ulimit -a? so cool). Never expected anything less from a Ditto (so non-biased by me ofc). Love u bye"
"lknobloc","This evaluation was an outstanding evaluation! Luca knew her get next line like no other, she even showed me about ulimits -a. Great experience, thank you Luca!!"
"lknobloc","We looked at everything and she explained the code properly. Every test case that popped into my head was successful! I could not crash it via the terminal, so I guess that's good. Congratulations and good luck with the rest of the evaluations! :)"

They have a thorough understanding of the products and services offered, and are able to provide detailed and accurate information to customers. They are also able to handle difficult situations with ease, and are able to defuse tense situations with tact and diplomacy. In addition, they are efficient and organized, able to multitask and prioritize effectively. Overall, the server is an asset to the company and a pleasure to work with. Good luck! :))"

"lknobloc","Very good done ! Seems complicated and right;)"
"lknobloc","great explanation  and walkthrough through all the projects! slight norme problem, otherwise all great."
"lknobloc","good work and explaned well"
"lknobloc","Your approach to solve the problem made sense, but it definitely would have taken too long. Let machines do the work for you! I always recommend to write using more functions and in general following the Norm, as it usually helps to see the logic more clearly. And also you have less work to do after... Have a look at the concepts we have talked about as they are essential to programming in general. You did a good job! Good luck for your third week of piscine!"
"lknobloc","very nice work, could explain her code really well! "
"lknobloc","Great work :)"

"lkucer","good job. I am sad that i am not allowed to write comments in my native language but code seems to work fine. I would say more if i am allowed to write Croatian :)"
"lkucer","The shortest printf I saw until now, really easy to read and Lana was able to explain everyhting. All my tests which are defined behaviour passed, as well as francinette. Great job!"

 "
"lkucer","Excellent work on the provided exercises!"
"lkucer","impressive work!!!! and perfect explanations! beautifully written! good luck :) "
"lkucer","Great job, good explains, the team worked together :D

 Unfortunately, there is some little problems:
 - When we have by example 100 or 100000, we have a dict error
 - External functions calls like read and open are not protected and it can produce an infinite loop in some cases

 Except that everything is fine!

 PS: You could only use 1 open and not 2, you could also put your error messages on the 2nd output (STDERR), doing a .PHONY in your makefile

 Good luck for the rest of the piscine and for the final exam! 🌻

"lyeh","Exellent! It was good evaluating you. Wish all good! :D"
"lyeh","its working so well and the code looks good and clear , good Errors handling ,but suddenly she had a norminette  Error"
"lyeh","wonderful work, she explained everything about she wrote, checked memory leak and other error situations, the code worked well, it should pass, congratulation."
"lyeh","Sadly the Makefile re-links, so the evaluation didn't go that far :("
"lyeh","awesome project! finally got to evaluate her since i havent seen her since the first picine. very readable code. nice explanations. love the use of libft lists! good job! :)"
"lyeh","Lea has a great understanding of the algorithm she implemented. We discussed ideas how to reduce the instructions even more, and she already knows many approaches. Sadly she didn't implement them, would have loved to see it.
 Great job though!"
"lyeh","Great radix sort haha
 Your code and everything around it looked impressive again! I would be cautious in the future with the .gitignore files even though they are actually great and helpful. Thank you for your explanations, for your time and have fun with so_long =D looking forward to playing it! :)"
"lyeh","Very well done as far as i can tell. explained the code in an understandable way and knew what it does. tried some test and they also seemed to work fine. Good luck with the next projects!"
"lyeh","Lea is very knowledgeable about the program she wrote. She explained the whole process well and made good drawings for us so we are able to follow what the program does. Great job!"
"lyeh","Well done and explained project! Also tested with a pipex tester and it works. Good job!"
"lyeh","Unfortunately, when the input command/file opening fails, the program completely skips the output command table, which is not the way bash behaves.
 A few commands were also not protected, other than that, the code is very nice and readable, no leaks and we had an extensive talk about the subject."
"lyeh","I really enjoyed this evaluation! We went through the logic of pipes and chlidren proccess, discussed the implementations. I learned a lot git fun stuff and things for my minishell. Thank you! Unfortunately, bonus part with multiple bonuses fail with smth like ./pipext Makefile cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat lol (double free) which is pity since the project is very well done. Good job:)"
"lyeh","Very good explanation  of the code and project in general. I can see a deep code and structure Understanding, all test were passed, hope will be OK for moulinette as well, Good Job, Lea :D"
"lyeh","ye, awesome project, sadge about missing strncmp( "
"lyeh","Great explanation of the code and the approach. Unfortunately there was one single wrong output for the easy.htr. They found the bug quite quickly. Really curious case since they never encountered that specific case in their tests. Thank you for the great explanations!"
"lyeh","Everything was done according to subject and she knew all the commands and explained it well."
"lyeh","Well done, she explain everything well"
"lyeh","good project, could explain everything also the password poilicy was right. good luck :)"
"lyeh","Explained very well. The code is working very well. Keep going:)"
"lyeh","Very good code and the evaluation session was very pleasant. Lea knows what she's doing. Good work and Thanks!"
"lyeh","We went through the code together and she gave a explanation on how it works. Well done keep it up."
"lyeh","good job! tested with tester and manually. all seems OK."
"lyeh","good job ! i hope Moulinette gives a good grade """
"lyeh","Thank you for that you explained everything. Code looks clean and good.  Great explanation!! Good luck!! :)"
"lyeh","Although I didn't fully understand every little detail, she made the overall structure and theory clear. Also I could see it working."
"lyeh","fixes issues in ft_lstmap and ft_split (check if memory is allocated correctly,if not freed all previous allocated memory -> no more mem leak) and removed forbidden terms in make file. We went through the code together. First the mistakes from last time. Then she explained parts I picked. Great explanations,cool person."
"lyeh","Code looks good. She explained me the fixes well, and code passes also francinette --strict, so good job!"
"lyeh","Really good work! She was able to explain what she did and did answer all my questions without problems. There were some minor issues here: ft_substr.c, ft_split.c, restrict, (compile-flags) and ft_lstmap.c (malloc). She knows how to fix the errors now, good luck next time! :)"
"lyeh","very good project but unfortunately there were minor mistakes in compilation and keyword usage: gcc instead of cc, std98 flag and restrict keyword. otherwise, the code seems correct, we discussed how to find memory leaks with valgrind and other interesting themes. good luck with the next attempt!"
"lyeh","code looks great and knows what shes doing"
"lyeh","Good Work! Nice explanation so that I could understand good luck for the final exam :D"
"lyeh","Very thorough explanation. Great Job on C06. Was nice catching up again : )
 Good luck on the exam!
 Also, did you know: It’s impossible to hum while holding your nose"
"lyeh","Good luck lyeh"
"lyeh","nice work"
"lyeh","Very motivated, I think everything is alright, but I lack the competence to really judge. Best of luck to the team"
"lyeh","They explained everything very thoroughly. I understood it really well :)"
"lyeh","we had a nice conversation, she has a deep understanding of her code and explained it very well :D"
"lyeh","very good nice code good luck"
"lyeh","it was great , Good luck"
"lyeh","very good explain good luck"
"lyeh","Best evaluation I had ever :)"
"lyeh","thanks! nice explanations! good luck:)
 "
"lyeh","Impressive coding skills, explained everything to me when I asked about details! :)"
"lyeh","good luck for the moulinette. You are well prepared and a real detective checking for mistakes. All the best!!!!!! :)"
"lyeh","Nice group, you are a really good rush program, you just forget to check the size of your argument. Everyone have understand the backtracking notion, congratulation and good luck!!"
"lyeh","very Hard working Women! very Helpfully."
"lyeh","very helpfully ! thanks !!!"
"lyeh","You did a great job there, but there are a lot of littles errors:
 You're displaying newlines even if the columns are null or negative;
 The prototype of the rush function is not well formatted following the subject's rules;
 There is another work folder that wasn't asked  in the subject, watch out to keep your repository clean!
 And next, your code is really heavy, with a lot of && and || operators, a lot of if conditions... You could really increase your code quality and readability. Ask others some examples, it should be really usefull for you!
 Keep working, that's great! Good luck for the next three weeks!"
"lyeh","impressive work. interesting algorithms used. thanks for explaining!"
"lyeh","very nice
 "
"lyeh","looks very good. Very good and detailed explanations.Thank you for that"
"lyeh","best explanation of ex08 I've seen "
"lyeh","Great work! I even learned something about ex08!"
"lyeh","very nice - keep up the great work! :)"
"lyeh","amazing work, typo: Y should be P"
"lyeh","Super explanation )"
"lyeh","Nice work. Explained very well! Learned something new!"
"lyeh","Explained every task trough"
"lyeh","friendly and very knowledgeable. shame about ex07"
"lyeh","Some issues but Lea know it this time."
"lyeh","Nice work! Misunderstood exercise 6"
"mafurnic","good job, it was a nice a valuation, I learned a lot. Good luck."
"mafurnic","Very nice explanation of the topic, you are clearly interested! All tests worked as they were supposed to, the code is clean and you were able to answer all of my questions. Well done!"
"mafurnic","Well done! It's great project and he explained it really good. Nice work :D"
"mafurnic","This is a very impressive project, Marian! I especially liked the third fractal, burning ship. You know your code very well and are clearly very taken with this subject. Keep up the good work and good luck for the exam! :)"
"mafurnic","The code looks good. Works correctly. We talked about some improvements that can be done to the Makefile. And make sure you can explain all the code. Good job!"
"mafurnic","nice project. have seen fract-ol the first time completly. and I have never done it as good as you. really well done (ps. i am bad at math) :)"
"mafurnic","Very nice. The server only uses 4 functions and the client is implemented using only 3!

 This is one of the cleanest Minitalk I've seen. Big props for that. Further more not even a single global variable has been used (a few static ones) but still, normally there is at least one.

 The code is very easy to understand and it does not use even a single malloc. I've tried to send huge strings, but the shell itself broke before Minitalk even showed any kind of problem.

 Great work, keep it up!"
"mafurnic","Great project! I was amazed to see a solution without global variables and without handshake. I didn't think it's possible! Were clean code, easy to read understand. Good luck with your next projects!"
"mafurnic","Well , everything seems like working. Moreover it works right. All my questions were answered. Perfect evaluation. Minitalk is just so great😂"
"mafurnic","Was a pleasant eval, no problems in explaining. Good luck for the next projects!"
"mafurnic","Marian did good job. It's impossible to crash it at all. Very nice error handling. Well done and gl with minitalk!"
"mafurnic","Very good work! He made sure to learn from his past mistakes on this projects and fixed everything! All the tests worked as they should! Nice guy, good luck!"
"mafurnic","Unfortunately one small leaks if there are duplicates in the input."
"mafurnic","Unfortunately there were some problems found by the previous evaluator."
"mafurnic","Well done project, radix works well, unfortunately, there are some mistakes:
 1. static functions declarations on .h file and unused variable in a file sort3.c
 2. compilaion without flags
 3. memory leak when for one invalid argument:   valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all -s ./push_swap e
 4. weird behaivor: ./push_swap -1 '-' '5'
 5. overflow checker is missed: ./push_swap -1 '-432432432434342343243224' '5'"
"mafurnic","Very good! You knew your code very well and it is super clean. Good luck on the exam :)"
"mafurnic","Great work! I was impressed, great understanding and i liked how you explained me everything! Keep it up like this! "
"mafurnic","Great work! Everything works :)"
"mafurnic","It was a good project, he had a good understanding of what he did and the general concept of setting up a computer/server with its basic services. Had to recheck some cmds which he noted down, but he knew what to look for. Could dig deeper in his knowledge of bash, but for this project it suffices. Good job, keep the motivation going!"
"mafurnic","The project looks great, he was really friendly"
"mafurnic","Good work. Have good understanding about the project. Explained everything. Good luck."
"mafurnic","Good Job! Keep Going! ^-^ "
"mafurnic","Very nice work, super clean code! Good luck :)"
"mafurnic","Good job, very nice looking code. Everything works :)"
"mafurnic","everything seems no problem, should pass moulinette, good luck."
"mafurnic","was a pleasure to speak about it :)"
"mafurnic","a nice chat with Marian, he explained me all that I needed to hear and he is actually doing very great and implemented in a nice way the functions. Everything is working properly and as expected. We did some tests manually as well. Good job!! Nice to meet you!!"
"mafurnic","Everything checks out, good work!"
"mafurnic","libft.a file still in there, but imo not a problem, hope moulinette doesn't see it as problem."
"mafurnic","Nice work! Francinette tests all went through green. Unfortunately the libft.a file was in git repo - not sure if Moulinette will detect that as an error :/
  He knows all his code and can explain it well :)
 Good luck with further evaluations!"
"mafurnic","Great work, everything is working :)"
"mafurnic","great work"
"mafurnic","well done "
"mafurnic","well coded, simple yet effective!! answered my questions, ty, have a good one . "
"mafurnic","ex00. it not work"
"mafurnic","ex00 should return 0, and returns 1"
"mafurnic","Nice work! Looks good to me :)"
"mafurnic","well doe, great work"
"mafurnic","Nice work and keep up the same !!"
"mafurnic","Good job, works as expected and the code is understood! :)"
"mafurnic","great work!!!"
"mafurnic","good job "
"mafurnic","good job! "
"mafurnic","looks nice, im still not at this level so i dont know if its right.
 need eval-points :)"
"mafurnic","great work and very good and understandable explanations. :)"
"mafurnic","good job, lets hope the 4th is also okay. Also good to see people approaching problems with different solutions"
"mafurnic","Everything looks nice, good job!"
"mafurnic","well done"
"mafurnic","Very nice and clean code, very much able to explain. great conversation partner"
"mafurnic","Everything looks great! thanks for leaving the main so we can check the output. Good luck with Moulinette!"
"mafurnic","Looks very nice, hope they pass moulinette too! Thanks for explaining the parts i didnt understand. "
"mafurnic","Although I don't do project c00, the code was clear."
"mafurnic","wonderful job:)"
"mafurnic","Very well done - and good discussion :)"
"mafurnic","nice work, i learned a lot of these codes!"
"mafurnic","No ex08, other than that all good!"
"mafurnic","Everything was fine. Ex08 was missing. Interesting solution to ex06. Great work"
"mafurnic","Knows his stuff, I learned something as well! Only ex08 is missing."
"mafurnic","good job! ex8 missing"
"mafurnic","everything was ok. except the 8th excercise was missing"
"mafurnic","Great work!"
"mafurnic","Well explained, clean code "
"marondon","Cuz of magnificent luck of his, he got hardest of 'em all. He knows his stuff. well done!"
"marondon","Marco did a great job. Could explain the basics of networking and all the exercises went well. Good luck for the last evaluation!"
"marondon","Not much depends on me, but gj!"
"marondon","Really solid program, which even works very efficient with higher numbers of threads. Next time test every single protection with multiplie cases ;)"
"marondon","Well done, everything works as it should. The only small issue we foud is that protection for function gettimeofday is wrong, and if it fails - invalid read/infinity loop occurs, however we came to conclussion that it is not the most important function of the project and should fail in only really edge cases:) As well i dont really like that time gets mixed up sometimes, so that messages 'from future' can be printed out (not after a philo dies). However it is still really solid implementation, all the cases are covered corectly. Keep up the good work!
 Just for future, please dont book 3 evals in a row:)"
"marondon","Really well-thought through, very efficient, passes most hard-core tests. Helgrind does not complain. The program exits immediately if one philo dies, even if time to sleep is very long. Every function is protected. Plenty cool solutions, I've learned a lot. Thanks for taking an hour to explain it. Impressive!"
"marondon","Impressive work! I do not know what so say else! :-) Keep up the good work!"
"marondon","Very good minishell, I really did my best but I did not find any way to crash it. GG guys keep it up!"
"marondon","Good job!

 P.S. I hate bash now! Thanks for killing the hope for love for me."
"marondon","Very nice so long game! I ate all the people. Everyone died. Nice game, no errors, everything works according to requirements. Thank you for explaining your code, it is clean and you have some cool solutions."
"marondon","Very nice project. Good explantions as well. Code was well written. Good work!"
"marondon","nice project marco!! Everything worked as expected!:)
 liked the animations and the theme of the game! good luck for the next one! :)"
"marondon","Was a very good project - good function names, clean code and he took a loooot of time to explain it to me - great job! :D"
"marondon","Thank you for taking all this time to explain everything, and making special effort for the explanations to be so vivid :-) Marked as outstanding because every step and every single command is protected, and special care was taken to make the program behave exactly like bash. Congrats for this impressive work!"
"marondon","Great project, could not find any bugs, great job!!
 Keep it up brother"
"marondon","The explanations were amazing, the person took two hours to discuss the bigger concepts and every little detail. Code works perfectly and is more efficient than required. We found only one small mistake in the bonus. Thank you so much for all your patience, and congrats for this impressive work!"
"marondon","Easily the most amazing common core project i have seen so far. It is clear you understand it in depth and that you had a lot of fun making it. Super interesting explanations, now i feel like i might be able to do this project as well. Nice memory handling as well. Good job!"
"marondon","I've seen you struggle on that project and I'm proud of you for how nice it came out:))
 Keep up the good work my friend <3"
"marondon","Good Job! Keep Going! ^-^"
"marondon","Thank you for explaning me everything now i fell like i am prepared for this project. Good luck Kepp up the good work man. Buenas noches."
"marondon","Great work! Took alot of time to explain his code, very simple and nice explanation! Thank you for that:) good luck with moulinette!"
"marondon","Nice work! best explaining ever :) "
"marondon","Thank you very much for all the explanations - he could also answer me every question I had for my own (current) born2beroot project so in my opinion it was really outstanding work :) Good luck with moulinette!"
"marondon","Everything very well explained, I have learned a lot. The server functions and all the requirements were met. Great job!"
"marondon","good job keep up the good work. o7"
"marondon","Nice work, looks decent and he could reasonably explain all questions. The exchange was constructive and he was eager to learn. Good luck further on!"
"marondon","Good work. Knows what he has done and can explain his desicions."
"marondon","great code, keep going:)"
"marondon","Great understanding of his code, had great notes in his code about theory and abouth is thoughts, very friendly and polite defense"
"marondon","It is definitley his code and he seems to strugle enough with it to be able to answer to all questions. Well done and good luck :)"
"marondon","Great job i hope everything is correct"
"marondon","Good work, could explain everything he did so that I could understand his code. Also when I tested the things I made wrong in my code I didn't see errors - well done :)"
"marondon","What a wonderful project! It was a pleasure to look and speak about the code! Everthing was perfect and nice explained!! Outstanding people and project! Keep it up like this!!"
"marondon","I tested everything and it works really well. Even with large maps it compiles very fast. Also they could explain everything they did - great job ! :)"
"marondon","good job! "
"marondon","Good try. No Makefile, open, read not protected. Norm errors. They code works and print out numbers. They were on a good way. But had no time to finish it. GG :)"
"marondon","Amazing work i hope it works this time!!"
"marondon","great work, master of coding"
"marondon","He's explanation was so clarify that i understand everything, but only on ex03 it doesn't sort the hundreds thousand digits, i'm sorry but i think you can fix it, good luck. Wish you the best! "
"marondon","Nice Work, he could really explain it very well :)"
"marondon","Good job, all the previous mistakes are corrected, everything works now )) good luck with moulinette ;)"

"marondon","i think every ex working ,ex 08 missing "
"marondon","Really good work, explains were good, a really nice discussion also

 Sadly the work haven't been pushed in a folder ex00, good luck for the next rush and for the rest of your piscine!"
"marondon","Great job. i am also confused about the last minute change but nicely explained."
"marondon","Good Job!"
"marondon","well done "
"marondon","fine work "
"marondon","ex06: NR%2 == 1 is the correct option
 ex07: skipping logic is incorrect (awk ""NR%2==0 || NR==1"")"
"marondon","no mistakes as far as I saw :) (P.S: will see if ex03 (with - type -f and type d) works,  ex06 with NR%2==0 or NR%2==1, and ex07 with awk ""NR%2==0 || NR==1"" is the same as NR%2==1)"
"marondon","very nice, check with moulinette very nice guy to be around"
"marondon","grat job!"
"marondon","looks good as far as i can tell, lets check with moulinette"
"marondon","Great explenation"
"mvoldema","really clean code - also very nicely explained - really knows what is going on very cool - keep up the good work!"
"mvoldema","Had a great talk about the project, really well done. Checked for every possible situation that can happen. Well done. Maybe different names for the files :)"
"mvoldema","Good done and explained! Good luck!"
"mvoldema","overall the project is nicely done. there is a small problem woth the collectables , so the evaluation stop there. but good luck next time :)"
"mvoldema","Overall very good project: there are no memory leaks for both valid and invalid inputs. The error management is implemented well, and all the cases required by the subject are covered accordingly. Sorting works independently of the number of the given arguments - already sorted arguments were handled as well. Especially for 500 arguments the algorithm is very effective! Congrats and keep up the good work :D"
"mvoldema","great explanation and clean code c:"
"mvoldema","Very clean code and super good explanations. good luck with the other evaluations!"
"mvoldema","Great explanation! he took his time to go through all his lines. good job!"
"mvoldema","The message transmission worked fine and in good speed. Code looks clean and was explained very well. Server could also handle larger strings and error handling was done as well. Good work!!!"
"mvoldema","great work, good explanations (how to calculate binaries to decimal), we explored the math behind in together and figuered out what the expression "" << ...."" kind of does behind the scenes"
"mvoldema","Great job on the project! :) he could explain all the terms very well"
"mvoldema","We gone truth every part and every commands , i ask questions for every single command and he could tell me what it makes and for what its good. I think he done a really good job because i understod everything soo good work and nice Evaluation :)"
"mvoldema","The first time a saw how a virtual machine works & how a you can create a new user and a password.
 He answered every question of the evaluation. Thx for your time"
"mvoldema","Functions works as it's supposed, the code is quite clean and effective, could be shortened here and there, but all in all good comprehension of its workings, very good! :)"
"mvoldema","know his code really well. explained the functions precisely. good luck :)"
"mvoldema","great job ! It's clear that you put a lot of effort into understanding the code and explaining it in a clear and concise way. Your thorough explanation of each line of code shows a strong grasp of the subject matter. Well done!"
"mvoldema","Very well done, he got some different code than me, but in total he explained his code flawless thank you."
"mvoldema","Everything seems to work, he did great! Good luck for your future projects"

"mvoldema","Great job! Looks clean and is able to explain everything. Crossing fingers :D"
"mvoldema","good job, good luck with moulinette"
"mvoldema","hope this passes, good luck :) "
"mvoldema","Unfortunately file shows some external header, from another 42 school.

 In general the logic is not always clear but the team showed interest in completing the task. The group could have managed better the division of tasks and could have probably benefited from sharing knowledge with other teams. My advice is to have a better look at all the new things you discovered during this rush and to make the best out of them.

 Good luck for your last week of piscine!"
"mvoldema","A good work, had a nice time talking about recursion, good luck!"
"mvoldema","Good work! Corrected very welk!"
"mvoldema","great job, nicly coded!!"
"mvoldema","Great job man, keep going!"
"mvoldema","GG, gj ,easy to understand code and could explain everything!"
"mvoldema","first 4 looked good :) checked with mains, output is the same :) well done"
"mvoldema","good job, clean codes c:"
"mvoldema","You have a great understanding of your code and your explanations are easy to understand. Thank you for your patience. I wish you good luck for the exam!"

"mvoldema","good job!"
"mvoldema","Good work!!"
"mvoldema","Really good work from a clearly connected team. Marty, Serge and Richard showed deep understanding of the problem and managed to write functional and minimal code. Still waiting for the max_int, let's hope it works! The logic looks good! Enjoy the rest of the piscine 🏊 GLHF 🤖"
"mvoldema","ex 08 space after  ."
"mvolgger","Very nice project, well implemented - great work! All tests were passed without problem. Well done!"
"mvolgger","Matthias did a great job explaining his code, good effort :)"
"mvolgger","Congrats on fixing your problem. Code runs well and is well explained."
"mvolgger","Everything works great, except a segfault when unseting the PATH. "
"mvolgger","it is written very neatly the program runs well and does what the subject required. its able to read maps and gives proper errors. well done and good luck with the next project."
"mvolgger","Clean code, thank you for explaining. Good luck!"
"mvolgger","Great job! Everything works very well. All mallocs are protected and I enjoyed the game! Thank you and good luck for the next evals! "
"mvolgger","No memory leaks, works 90% of the subject tasks. But I couldn't give f.ex. 80points, because I've found the error -- if E is surrounded by walls, the program works and doesn't print ""invalid map"". I gave 20min to resolve this problem and the peer didn't.
 A little bit more work with this project and everything will be fine. Good work!  "
"mvolgger","Nice so_long! I like the ham-tokens and Matthias put a lot of effort into the map validation. The game is playable and there were no leaks in any case. Maybe think about taking the absolute path for the maps as a parameter instead of a relative one and maybe also limit the map size. But overall the game is running smoothly and is fun to play : )"
"mvolgger","No error message with overflow ./push_swap 18446744073709551616
 for the overflow you the overflow checker should have been in the while loop
 but everything else looks good no valgrinds detected and the function sorts
 "
"mvolgger","Good project, really good amt of moves! the 500 comes a little close to the benchmark but is overall below 5500. Nice implementation, GL!"
"mvolgger","Really nice explanation. Made me understand a different approach to the project. Keep up the good work :)"
"mvolgger","there was no problem with funcheck, valgrind , edge case ... code was nice and clean, but unfortunately it was slow for sorting. good luck for next time. thank you"
"mvolgger","Great work! Everything works as expected, he explained everything. Good luck in future projects and exam!"
"mvolgger","very well explained. good job!"
"mvolgger","Good work. Understand the project very well. Could explain everything. Able to show me what was required by the subject. Very well done."
"mvolgger","checked all function it works as per expectations . bonus part is also working fine . thank you ."
"mvolgger","Good code. Only problem is that the max number of a fd is limited to 1024. An improvement could be to store the number of the fd independend of the internal data structure.
 He could explain his code. Good luck for Moulinette"
"mvolgger","Unfortunately, not everything is freed in the bonus part (only one string and not the whole array)
 Otherwise the code looks great, tried to break it but could not:))
 Good luck!"
"mvolgger","Code is okay, except the BUFFER_SIZE was not defined, so the compilation without -D crashes. Unfortunatelly. There could be also added a condition in the reading loop in case in remainder there alredy is a next line."
"mvolgger","Great work! Good conversation :)"
"mvolgger","Clean code explained it well good luck with your evals!"
"mvolgger","Looks good, was able to explain everything about his code and pointed out special edge cases."
"mvolgger","Very good job, and clearly understands what he wrote. We discussed our different approaches as well."
"mvolgger","Everything works fine, very good work :)"
"mvolgger","everything is working fine! good work  and good explanations!"
"mvolgger","Good clear functions, good explanation of his code."
"mvolgger","no ex08, but honestly, who actually did that mess... Good Code, and could explain it as well"
"mvolgger","Ex08 n. att., everything else checked out beautifully, fluent explanations, good work!"
"mvolgger","good work, explanation was also perfect."
"mvolgger","Good Job. Fixed the mistake in ex03. Keep it up :)"
"mvolgger","Nice work and clean code. Could explain me everything and answered my questions. Keep up the good work :-)"
"mvolgger","Friendly  guy. Explained well. Ultra close on three but for some magical reason it swallows one parameter.  Good Luck on solving that:)"
"mvolgger","small mistake at last exercise, lets try again :)"
"mvolgger","Great Job, well explained, nothing turnend in ex04 ex05. :)"
"mvolgger","Nice, clean code, looks good and well explained!"
"mvolgger","Looks good, nice guy:D"
"mvolgger","great guy , understands his code very well :D"
"mvolgger","everything works accordingly, knows how to explain, overall good work, keep it up! :)"
"mvolgger","good understanding of the code,
 all the best :)"
"mvolgger","Peer had clear understanding of exercises , unfortunately ex3 had a minor error, which the evaluee could explain. Very informative . Goodl Luck"
"mvolgger","He explained well, code looks good!!"
"mvolgger","Good job and well explained! Thanks a lot and good luck. Ex11 + Ex12 not done yet."
"mvolgger","everything was great besides a little mistake on exercise 6."
"mvolgger","everything is well explained and knew about the codes looks clean and very nice work gj and good luck :)"
"mvolgger","great work knows his code well"
"mvolgger","explained and answered my questions, great job"
"mvolgger","Well written code, innovative way to solve the 8th task, good explanations, unfortunately some error in the beginning. "
"mvolgger","knows the code very good, very nice explanation, good job! "
"mvolgger","well done, some (minor but still) mistake in ex07 means it won't work in a special case - keep up the good work!"
"mvolgger","good work. Sadly a norm error. The code looked really good. They understand their code. Shows a lot of interest on coding. gg :)"
"mvolgger","Very very good, made me happy! :D"
"mvolgger","Exercise 06 was not correct. Evaluation stopped."
"mvolgger","Everything right except ex05 small pain in the ass mistake"
"mvolgger","Good job!!"
"mvolgger","Good job. Could explain everything. Good luck."
"mvolgger","good work small details are wrong"
"mvolgger","Minor unfortunate mistake, but overall good project :)"
"mvolgger","There was a small mistake, otherwise exercises were done great."
"mvolgger","Good work!"
"mwanjura","works perfectly fine! props to you, simple and effective approach. GL with the next one :)"
"mwanjura","Good job, i run all testes i remembered for this project, i didnt find anything so it should be fine with moulinntee aswell."
"mwanjura","Good job, I went through the code with him and all mallocs are protected and the behavior for all test cases I could manually come up with were perfect.

 As for the bonus part, one static variable was used. There is no mention in the subject of how the bonus files have to be named, so I only care about the functionality of the bonus.
 Multiple file descriptors were not handled, but since Marco has such a short entry function, it will be super easy if he decides to push it again."
"mwanjura","His code passed all of my tests. Good luck with Moulinette."
"mwanjura","A very clean and simple solution."
"mwanjura","well done on this project, was nice to see that u didn't use any malloc. code looks clean. thanks for the nice explanation! :)
 See u around!"
"mwanjura","Everything seems correct."
"mwanjura","All from eval sheet was fulfilled. The knowledge of student is a bit rusty he should refresh his knowledge before eval. Good luck!"
"mwanjura","there were some minor mistakes but he understands what the project is about and could explain everything."
"mwanjura","Good work! Thanks for the explanations! Good luck!"
"mwanjura","Everything looks good, good explanation. Good luck!"
"mwanjura","good code, tested it, ft_split looks fixed, other looked good too, good luck!"
"mwanjura","sadly incorrectly protected str in ft_split, which lead to a segv. in the count_words functions. It is important to check if the str is null before calling count_words.

 Code on ft_split could also be more readable but other than that it works fine."
"mwanjura","great. good look"
"mwanjura","ex07 works now perfectly in all cases, no timeout and all correct. Good job Marco!"
"mwanjura","Previously he failed atoi, now it works. Great work, explained it clearly."
"mwanjura","good job dude .keep it up!!"
"mwanjura","looks clean and logic to me! good luck with Moulinette !!:))"
"mwanjura","nice code and good work keep it up"
"mwanjura","good work, friendly evaluation. some great codes, realy short and compact ! keep up the good work ."
"mwanjura","Everything correct except ex07. You're doing good. Keep it up."
"mwanjura","error previous evaluator found on 05 for negative numbers"
"mwanjura","Good code. Interesting solution for the square root. He has a nice personality and it is a pleasure to work with him. Thanks."
"mwanjura","The makefile works a bit. They did some error handling. Good try. But missing the main part. Keep going gg :)"
"mwanjura","Codes tested and they work all fine. Good job. Good luck."
"mwanjura","Super code!
 He gave very good detailed explanations. Very friendly guy!"
"mwanjura","Interesting solutions. Well organized code. Good luck!"

"mwanjura","great "
"mwanjura","nice work, clean code. Good explonation"
"mwanjura","codes look clear good luck"
"mwanjura","clean code, everything was explained very well, keep it up :)"
"mwanjura","Great work, just a minor mistake in ex02. Included space when it was not needed."
"mwanjura","everything fine"
"mwanjura","Good teamwork although the norm was not okay at all and the code was not properly woking but they were aware about that. Error handling was not done at all. Take a look at malloc and free. Also Valgrind and lldb might be useful. Good luck for the next projects!"
"mwanjura","Great work. Good luck with futher projects."
"mwanjura","Great job!"
"mwanjura","norm error"
"mwanjura","norme :((("
"mwanjura","Interesting to his code, well done!!!"
"mwanjura","Everything is good. He know what he is doing. Keep up!!!"
"mwanjura","thank you for the explaination! good job!!"
"mwanjura","Looking good"
"mwanjura","very clean code and good explanation"
"mwanjura","Well done!"
"mwanjura","Good teamwork, but the folder should be the expected one! Moreover, there were some other mistakes.
 Always take care of the max int and take a look into the program arguments! Good luck for your next projects! ^_^"
"mwanjura","clear code, good work"
"mwanjura","great guy to talk to"
"mwanjura","Code worked, everything fine."
"mwanjura","did good job. "
"mwanjura","typo in ex06, good work in general"
"mwanjura","Well done!"
"mwanjura","Just some small details."
"mwanjura","very friendly, polite and good explanation but a mistake :)"
"mwu","Very well done, talked a lot about the project, tested as much as I can and everything worked. Good job and good luck for whats to come!"
"mwu","They did a decent job, the one thing i found was ""<<eof1 > file1 | <<eof2"" that here file1 sould not be created when we are at the second heredoc. But this definitely falls to the go crazy part i think."
"mwu","Awesome work. everything seems to work great, and the explanations were helpful and clear! have a great day!"
"mwu","Unfortunately, we found that memory is not being freed when exiting from the child processes, we had a long discussion about it but after careful consideration we came to the conclusion that rules are rules.
 For reference: All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
 will be tolerated.
 Other than that, this minishell is rock solid, GL next time!"
"mwu","Such a cool team, they both wrote large parts of the code independently, compared the results, and made decisions accordingly. As a result, they both have very good understanding of the project. Thank you very much for all the explanations, will be back for more!"
"mwu","Wow it was a good and hard to test everything project, u guys did a good job and thankfully I get to test the confusing parts for my own project:) good luck with next eval and thanks for the explanations."
"mwu","asdf/ is command.
 ./minishell in minishell signals inherited.
 ctrl + \ is not doing anything in blocking command. should quit exit code 131
 exit 123 123 exits the shell but it should print just the error message for double args.
 Really good minishell. Beside minor issues above everything is good. Should be easy fix. Good luck!"
"mwu","Very nice project, everything works perfectly as expected. He also explained his code very well. Deep understanding of the project. :)"
"mwu","No crashes or leaks found. Only a very small potential lock ordering issue, which doesn't affect the program in 99.9% of the cases. It's more of a warning than anything else. The logic in normal circumstances is consistent."
"mwu","Great Job , student explained everything and his code works perfectly ,we tested everything .Good luck on future projects!"
"mwu","codes look good no memory leaks detected and no norminette errors in the functions. Is the last project good luck with the exam 03. :)"
"mwu","Peer had strong knowledge of requirements and we went trough some tests everything looks good.
 "
"mwu","great job some confusions but the code seems alright and handles both valid and invalid inputs properly"
"mwu","Problem to solve with Julia set. Good luck !"
"mwu","Thank you for explaining! clear code! Good luck!"
"mwu","amazing job! Really understood the code and explained everything."
"mwu","Great explanations, the person has also showed me a different method that can receive any string but prints slower. Very educational! Thank you for time and patience!"
"mwu","Great code and implementation, everything works smoothly. We ran all the tests and no errors were found. Even the bonus part was implemented nicely. Good work!"
"mwu","Great work! Was able to explain me what he did and how he implemented his code. We run several checks and everything looked fine! Good luck with the other evaluations."
"mwu","Great work! Explained everything very good! Learned a lot from you! "
"mwu","Unfortunately memory leaks happen when there is a wrong argument or an empty array, but overall everything looks good. Should be a quick fix and good luck after)"
"mwu","Good work! Could explain his code in detail. Also showed me why he didn't move to the bonus. Really structured code and work.  Good luck for the next evals!"
"mwu","The minitalk works this time :) I didn't find any mistake, bonus works too with unicode. Good job. Hope you pass."
"mwu","Could explain his code very well. But unfortunately the output is incorrect with long texts.
 Had a nice chat about errorcodes. Really nice guy! "
"mwu","Unfortunately crashes when the client is started without any arguments. Also the mandatory part doesnt work with a large message (1000 words). Still checked the rest and it works also the bonus part is fine, so should be a quick fix! GL "
"mwu","He explained his doing very well and in great detail. No issues, good project:)"
"mwu","Great job! Knows how to do everything as needed! Perfect!"
"mwu","Good work, explained everything very well and answered all the questions. good luck :)"
"mwu","Good project, did the bonus part, tests checked out and was bale to explain. Good job!"
"mwu","Well done project. Code looks good and works. Tested with francinette and passes it. The only thing is reading whole file at once, but works as it should so it is no problem."
"mwu","Was amazing! Took the time to explain everything, helped me a lot! Thanks and good luck!"
"mwu","Good code, with all previous fixed mistakes, looks nice for me, good luck Mw :D"
"mwu","Nice, clean code. Interesting solution without using the libft library."
"mwu","Project looks great, previous errors have been addressed and now seems to be working great."
"mwu","Unfortunately there was a single malloc not protected. Everything else works great. Good luck for your next submission."
"mwu","Good job! Everything looks great besides a missing NULL-Check in the ft_printf which should be pretty easy to fix. Good luck for the next evaluations!"
"mwu","Well done! My congratulations! The code is clear and has only necessary functions, good job! "
"mwu","Very well explained, great work! I hope this is the last try ;)"
"mwu","We checked everything that failed before and now everything looks perfect :))"
"mwu","Everything works well, francinette had no problem either. Makefile also checks out. Wish you luck with moulinette. Good job with the bonuses."
"mwu","Well, really good implementations over all. We took our time to talk about most of the functions and everything seemed fine. Good luck with your last evaluations and your next projects! See you next time :)"
"mwu","Code looks clean and was explained perfectly also very polite!"
"mwu","Used gcc instead of cc."
"mwu","Great job! ex04 wont be compiled because of forgotten 1 inside code"
"mwu","Everything looks good! Great job!"
"mwu","Great work"
"mwu","Good luck!"
"mwu","Nice try. Norm error. Malloc not protected. open not protected. It print out numbers. Error handling works not really good. Good work keep it up. GG :)"
"mwu","Ex01 and Ex02 have the same mistake. For the rest all is ok."
"mwu","good luck with moulinette!"
"mwu","I think are working"
"mwu","ex03 looks good, great job!"
"mwu","looks very good and should not timeout this time!"
"mwu","timeout seems to be fixed, good job!"
"mwu","Thank you for the explanation, very useful and running code."
"mwu","Excellent work, still have to figure out one special case in exercise 3, but otherwise perfect"
"mwu","Forgot to comma out the main function in ex05, otherwhise nice code. Good job!"
"mwu","Everything is fine, only the norminette didn't approve ex05 :((
 But anyway good job!)"
"mwu","Very nice and good luck !"
"mwu","well done"
"mwu","well done"
"mwu","It should be ok"
"mwu","nice work! good luck :)"
"mwu","power 0 ==> 1
 power 1 ==> nb
 goood job, nice recursivity; good luck "
"mwu","brilliant idea for writing the code of ex03 && ex04, perfect explanation.
 One typo on ex04, a little mistake but you can change it quickly, good luck for the next evaluation!!"
"mwu","great work! thank you for explaining!"
"mwu","Good work! keep it up!"
"mwu","Very good work and didn't spot any errors with the code "
"mwu","Great code, explained everything in detail. Congratulation."
"mwu","great job !"
"mwu","good work!"
"mwu","nice job. thanks for the explanation for 11"
"mwu","ex02: small mistake in the return value
 ex06: do not include `127`
 ex10: if `size` is `0` return the length of `src`. `i < (size - 1)`
 ex11: `127` is not a printable char"
"mwu","Starting from ex02 the return is 0 when str = """" but should be 1. That's a shame the code look great..."
"mwu","Very good work and splendid explanations! :)"
"mwu","polite, excellent"
"mwu","Good explanations and comprehension of the code. Try to take a better look to argc and argv and learn how to use the man, it will help you a lot!! ^_^"
"mwu","that was great command,good luck"
"mwu","Great job, also you are the first person i evaluated who didnt use bubble sort."
"mwu","Great guy, he has a great understanding of his code. He can also explain it very well :D
 Ex08: Empty"
"mwu","good code xD"
"mwu","Great conversation and the colleague does know what he is doing. The ex 07 is  missing something but is on the right direction. E 08 is missing. Keept it uo like this and you will succeed! :)"
"mwu","Great work, ex07 has a few bugs, need to look into those. For ex05 and ex06 maybe Moulinette does not like the new lines at the end."
"mwu","Running code, helpful explanations, thank you."
"mwu","It works and looks good."
"mwu","Great work! Just need to fix the typo in ex03."
"mwu","change file name on ex03, rest looks good great work:)"
"mwu","Could explain all question very well, has an excellent grasp of the knowledge required for the exercises. Great job! :)"
"mwu","Everything amazing!"
"mwu","The time was for test2 missspelled 23 22 :) the rest was fine "
"mwu","ex02: time stamp on test2 is wrong
 all other exercises seem correct"
"mwu","Almost perfect. So sorry for the duplicate evaluation appointments!"
"mwu","mostly well done, little mistake in the beginning :)"
"mzolfagh","They made a really great work! Thanks for a lot of explanations! "
"mzolfagh","Found some small mistake with exit and no argument - then there is no exit code taken to the parent shell. Else all the stuff is working. Good luck for the last eval!"
"mzolfagh","Das ist fantastisch. I checked all edge cases that I could remember. Everything passed. Small issue with signals but fixed on place so it's good for me. Good luck with next evaluators!"
"mzolfagh","The minishell looks already really good. Lots of the cases are handled properly. But we found some mistakes - I'm sure you will fix them fast: when there is minishell opened in minishell there is a double ""\n"". When the PATH is unset there is no error message. In case of ""mkdir a cd a mkdir b cd b rm -rf ../../a  then no cd works anymore. with only "">asdf"" there is an open file descriptor
 with ""< 2 | << 3 asdf"" there is also an open file descriptor. Good look!"
"mzolfagh","They could explain the code very well. They had some small issues in the minishell, but these are fine with me. Good luck with your next evaluations."
"mzolfagh","Amazing person! It was a pleasure to hear about this project AND he explained so that i can understand everything (such a great tutor) . Amazing programmer in my opinion and i think he has a big understanding of the greater picture and the importance! Thank you that i could evaluate you! Good luck in the future!"
"mzolfagh","Looks fantastic! Interesting menue if no parameters are given and special mention to the changing julia sets depending on the mouse position. Well done!"
"mzolfagh","Awesome project! Very cool to look and play with. Thank you for the detailed explanation, it wasn't as complicated as I feared. Good luck with your next projects!"
"mzolfagh","Great job!Student explained his code perfectly and the methods that he used for it.Good luck  in future projects!
 "
"mzolfagh","Unfortunately the bonus part did not behave as expected. Other than that the mandatory part worked more than perfectly and through the explanations you could clearly see that he put loads of time into reading up on theory to be able to have a fundamental understanding for the next projects. Thank you!"
"mzolfagh","Code is very clean and well explained, congrats and good luck!"
"mzolfagh","He explained well. He passed all the tests written and also showed me more error cases and passed. Really good work! :)"
"mzolfagh","The previous evaluator already found all the issues and I was able to sit next to it. We also tried a pipex tester and it confirmed one issue that was found, the executing from a full path instead of the alias.
 Very friendly person and interesting discussions. Also creative approach for the here_doc bonus, I really like it!"
"mzolfagh","We found few bugs together,
 1. with notexist input file the others commands need to be executed
 2. need to handle full path of commands
 3. (optional) print out error message with the format <PROGRAM_NAME>: ....: <ERROR_MSG>
 4. need to check if the command is executable or not

 But the pipex handle the pipe() really well, only need 6fd with multiple cmds"
"mzolfagh","Nice job!
 No leaks and all pipes do the same as build in pipe.
 Also multiple pipes and here_doc have been handled (bonus)
 Good luck with the next eval!"
"mzolfagh","good projekt, it seems very nice,
 i do not know because the bash have anther behavior like shell, but i think its OK"
"mzolfagh","He explained me how the code works. All tests has passed. Very good job! Good luck and thanks for the explanation :)"
"mzolfagh","Mohamad did a very great job on his pushswap he even implemented his own algorythm thanks to his knowledge in mathemmetics. his algorythm orks really well and always got the best results so i certainly think that he deserves this outstanding project thingy thing. good job !
  "
"mzolfagh","Norminette error! :/"
"mzolfagh","Very good work, could explain everything perfectly. nicely done."
"mzolfagh","VERY well explained, I could understand everything. We tested all prompts and worked through it step by step. GL!"
"mzolfagh","Nice project, the concepts were all understood and explained adequately. The shell script was also understood in detail and some solutions I have never seen anywhere else. Nice job."
"mzolfagh","you did a very nice job on explaining and coding this project - all tests passed also with the bonus - very nice structured code - good luck!"
"mzolfagh","Well done! Everything works as it should be. He explained me all his code. Knows it and how it works. Good luck :)"
"mzolfagh","Great stuff, all the errors should be fixed now. I have nothing more to add.
 Don't trust funcheck too much ..."
"mzolfagh","Very good code, he was able to explain all of it and justify his implementations. Unfortunately two small leaks exist, when a malloc in the get_next_line function is failing."
"mzolfagh","Great job! Learned some cool new stuff, thanks :)"
"mzolfagh","thanks for the thorough explaining and the tips on the usage of lists and how it is more handy to use them,  learned a lot! good luck for the next project! "
"mzolfagh","Really great work! I finally understood the bonus part of printf. Good luck on your future projects! :)"
"mzolfagh","Protect your malloc! Very nice implementation of printf albeit sometimes hard to understand. But potential crash: we need to be more vigilant with malloc protections!"
"mzolfagh","The function has uninitialized variable, that causes a bunch of problems. Also your function doesnt work with %x in case you have int min for x conv (ft_printf(""%x"", -2147483648);). I am sure you will fix it soon, wish you good luck with that!"
"mzolfagh","Great job, code looks crazy! Well done!"
"mzolfagh","Clean code good to see the bonus part in action ! good luck!"
"mzolfagh","Great project! Nice guy. Everything seems to be working fine! OUTSTANDING!!!"
"mzolfagh","great job! everything looks good however I am very tired :)"
"mzolfagh","Nice work! We discussed the code at length and checked every function. Everything looks very clean and makes sense. We discussed some implementation details. Fun!"
"mzolfagh","small mistake in split (check second malloc) and lst_map (del content if malloc fails). other than that, great work! :)"
"mzolfagh","One minor mistake in ft_strlcat. He is aware of that. Good luck!"
"mzolfagh","The code is clear. All of the functions work correct, only a small issue with ft_strlcat function for next output:
 ft_strlcat(str, ""abcd"", 0), original returns 4, while your returns 0:("
"mzolfagh","Thank you for explaining, was my 2nd eval on C09 and good to see the malloc-safety check on this one! Have a good one there!"
"mzolfagh","Perfect explanations, clean code, he knows very well his code. Great evaluation! Keep working like this, you are good! :)"
"mzolfagh","Nice code and the explination was the same, cool guy, gl :)"
"mzolfagh","very in depth explanation, everything seems to work accordingly. good luck for moulinette!!! :) "
"mzolfagh","Ammm.... Yeah it happened. Norm failed, hard. Good guys, were excited :("
"mzolfagh","In the repo is only 1 .c file and 1 .dict file. So there is nothing to check, but they have a lot of questions about the Makefile and how does headers works so we talked about this stuff. Good luck next time! "
"mzolfagh","Very well explained and written! Knows everything about his code! Great job! :)"

"nsassenb","Very god explained! thx! friendly guy!"
"nsassenb","Really nice team with a really incredible clean code. The algorithm works as it should do and the whole team showed their knowledge in what they wrote. All exemple we tested worked as they should (error or output of a solution). I did not expect such a great work it is impressiv. Unfortunatly error are printed in the wrong files descriptor (1 instead of 2), You should check the return of your malloc function and exit your program in case the allocation did not work. Also do not forget to check that you have to free your memory in all cases (use valgrind). Thanks for the nice exchange and beeing still positiv!!!!!"
"nsassenb","Nice Guy clean code. Still some headroom for explanations."

"nweghofe","great project. great display of skill as expected. :-)"
"nweghofe","We went over the code, she knows her code very well, prepared the test cases in the main already, she also explained her tricks, especially writing the constructor chaining, and how she handled the diamond problem with inheritance from super class and subclasses. Purely amazing! Good luck :)"
"nweghofe","all OK, thanks for explanations. tested with negative numbers also"
"nweghofe","good work. everything was explained nicely and the code looks really clean and works as intended.
 const is used when required.

"nweghofe","good work. clean code "
"nweghofe","Overwhelming! Very good explaination! Check of external function in example file signals.c OK."
"nweghofe","Prior to the actual evaluation, Nicol and I had already looked for any potential errors and extensively checked the number of operations required for various permutations of different magnitude. To my knowledge, no permutations take more than 700 or 5500 moves for lengths 100 and 500, respectively; the execution time was also negligible in all tested cases. An impressive attention to detail and a great project, all in all."
"nweghofe","Very remarkable project. Incredible and outstanding work. She cleverly constructed her sorting algorithm to cut down on the operators. I definitely was able to learn a lot from her. I wish her on the next orbit all the best! good luck with minishell!"
"nweghofe","Everything from Error Management, memory leaks and the sorting was handled very well. The checker showed OK in all cases. The algorithm sorts amazingly efficient and is constructed very very clever. Bonus works fine as well. Congratulations!!!"
"nweghofe","Great project! From Graphic and Parameter Management to the creation of the fractals everything was handled well. we discussed not only the basic functionality of the code but also went into details about the algorithms themselves - Nicols understanding of the subject and the mathematics behind it are impressive! Thanks for talking your time, i learned a lot during the defense!!!"

"nweghofe","this is a short and clever project. it is is so short, that you coould lean out the window a  bit and also call it ""mini"". did you ever try haselnusscino at cafe+co automat? its great. but only with a paper cup. be aware of plastic! no no no greta. we aint dealin with your plastic. giggigty. did you know that greta is already 20 years old? wow. what an outstanding young girl who did SO much for the climate change. i love italy. im there almost every year! the foirdt time i got there i went from tunisia with a boat, but we got deported back immediatley. the second try did it. anyway. all in all. good work nicole
 pepperoin"
"nweghofe","It was a cool wednesday night when I was faced with the task of reviewing Nicol ""Code Hog"" Weghofer's minitalk project. Gleefully, I marched towards her chosen, nay, destined, seating. What I witnessed is nothing short of a small coding miracle: a minitalk project which could only be compared in its length to an entry in a sunday gazette's obituary. The thing that passed away? Any minute remainder of doubt that our ""Code Hog"" is an amateurish programmer. I loved everything about the project I was presented. My deepest appreciation and respect goes out to you, Nicol. Yours truly, Alexander."

 This is a relatively simple fix though, so I hope everything else goes well for both. All the best!"

 Unfortunately there is some little things that will be fix super fastly:
 - forbidden function: getpid
 - crash when there is a problem in the prompt (rm a current path), the prompt will segfault due to strrchr
 - the signals inside a child: exit codes not good and you will have duplicate signals
 - export test=""s -la"" l$test -> ""ls -la : command not found"" -> you should resplit before sending the command in this case

 Good luck for fixing this things and for the repush! I really enjoyed the doxygen documentation btw

 I liked you project. You did a great job. Thank you for giving me a deep dive explanation about your shell and how th paths work.

 we double checked everything. Good luck for the next eval! :)"

"phnowak","Very nice work and good explanations. I learned about sysexits.h codes and might use it for Minishell. Also about scan build and scan view to check source code for logical errors, I definitely need to look into that. Thanks for the discussion, I think you're on the right track.
 Just for admin: no leaks, no norminette errors and the program behaved as it should in each case I put it through."

We tested all valid and invalid maps, incluiding invalid characters, empty lines and more than one players. Errors with explanations, it was very clean. The game quit in a clean way without mem leak. One thing I really like that he was very careful about the requirement of the subjects. In his game, cutie cat(player) could collect all the collectibles and then exit the game.  Very very nice!

"phnowak","Damn he actually implemented quicksort in this project. This is so much code wew. But it works perfectly except the error management. You should always calculate with retarded users that input non-numeric characters. Nevertheless solid wörk :)"
"phnowak","apparently you printed out error two times when an error occures"
"phnowak","Very smartly written code, I've learned a lot during this evaluation, even though I'm not as far with my projects. He was able to explain everything and it's clear he knows what he's doing. Keep up the good work and good luck with your coming projects!"
"phnowak","great work, good that you use the quick-sort algo. great explained, and he knew a lot about the project and how to use the the commands and the Algo. He does not the ERROR Management, but its okay. Keep up the good work. and good luck :) "
"phnowak","Tested it with all shell commands I knew. Worked as it was supposed to. even set an environment variable with the command and passed that to pipex. Norminette also didn't complain and I could find no memory leaks. overall nice work "
"phnowak","All tests looked fine & norm ok.
 Great and easy explanations! Thank you for taking some extra time & additional tips.
 "
"phnowak","great project, great work, great dude! He knows what he did and the program past all tests. He explain me very good and answered a lot of questions . NO LEAKS. NO CRASH. ALL GREAT, Keep up the good Work. "
"phnowak","""Just"" an addition of the bonuspart. Everything seemed fine, and it was nice to go back to easier libft-times. Good luck with the rest of your projects! :)"
"phnowak","Seems to know what he is doing!"
"phnowak","Great work, beautiful and simple code. Well done!"
"phnowak","Awesome work!! great job in explaining first errors and functions as well as how to use one static variable only. Crossing fingers!"
"phnowak","Good job, fixed his prior mistakes and now everything works perfectly as it should . Well done!"

"phnowak","We had a nice chat, he was able to explain everything in detail. Good luck with Mouli! :)"
"phnowak","Pretty  nice virtual machine. Works good  no GUI was installed. Here is some suff about VM:
 A ""virtual machine"" was originally defined by Popek and Goldberg as ""an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real computer machine."" Current use includes virtual machines that have no direct correspondence to any real hardware. The physical, ""real-world"" hardware running the VM is generally referred to as the 'host', and the virtual machine emulated on that machine is generally referred to as the 'guest'. A host can emulate several guests, each of which can emulate different operating systems and hardware platforms. "
"phnowak","First cloned the folder, file is inside. .vid matches.
 PO: He could explain everything in detail and also explain the difference between CentOS and Debian.
 Ss: He helped me well when I wanted to start UFW and SSH.
 U: We have created a new user, changed passwords,...
 Sudo is available and also the execution was explained to me in detail.
 Bonus: Partitiopons(X), WordPress(X) and choice service available. This part was also explained very well.

 All in all, the evaluation has been very good. The peer was able to find a solution to all questions and also seemed confident in the execution. He was calm and well prepared. I was able to take away a lot because I am currently creating my VM myself.
 Keep up the good work and good luck. :) 1+* "
"phnowak","nice job. we tested in a group. he installed some additional services like cockpit, lighttp, neofetch und banner. the cockpit was working well at browser at port 9090. he could answer the theory questions well.. the signature was also correct. good luck!"

 heres a croissant recipe for your trouble:
 The Process
 make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk
 roll out dough into a large rectangle
 make the butter layer (I have an easy trick for this!!!)
 enclose the butter layer inside the dough
 roll out the dough into another large rectangle, then fold it back together
 roll out the dough again, fold it back together again
 roll out the dough one more time, fold it back together
 shape the croissants
 bake"

"ppfiel","Very good explanation of the exersizes. As always a very good evaluation session. Have learned much. Btw. Herodotus[a] (Ancient Greek: Ἡρόδοτος, romanized: Hēródotos; c. 484 – c. 425 BC) was a Greek historian and geographer from the Greek city of Halicarnassus, part of the Persian Empire (now Bodrum, Turkey) and a later citizen of Thurii in modern Calabria, Italy. He is known for having written the Histories – a detailed account of the Greco-Persian Wars. Herodotus was the first writer to perform systematic investigation of historical events. He is referred to as ""The Father of History"", a title conferred on him by the ancient Roman orator Cicero.[2][3]"

In ex01 when we put more numbers than value of span we get zsh: IOT instruction (core dumped)  ./span but as student said that is because not catching the error but he is throwing it so for me das ist gut. That's it from me. Bye. Aufiderzen!"
"rperkman","Very clear written code. Much better than subject description)"
"rperkman","Great job! He explained everything really well and all the exercises worked perfectly fine. Thanks for the explanations and good luck for the future!"
"rperkman","Well done, exercises work as they should. Only issue in ex00 that double is casted as a float and char literals are not handled. As well take a look again of casts, and change cc in makefile for c++, even if it works, it is not the thing that is mentioned in subject, as well as fix typo for phony in makefile."
"rperkman","Well done, the code looks clean and you explained everything very well. Good luck for the next one!"
"rperkman","We checked everything from the eval sheet. I didn't do it so he explained me all exercises and a little bit of C++ so I can better understand it and to prepare for this hell. Thank you for your explanation now after which I will leave school or I will just cry. So I will just write some more so that I can get achievement. I hope you don't mind it. That's I need to go. Bye Roman!"
"rperkman","Good job, I struggled with cpp since I havent done it for a long time but you helped me really well. thanks a lot. Very well done :)"
"rperkman","Unfortunately use friend keyword for << operator overloding. The RobotomyRequestForm was not correctly implemented concerning the 50% chance of getting robotomized (usage of srand and rand perhaps).
 Also last exercise is necessary to pass the project.

 Otherwise good project and a lot of tests were implemented! Good luck with next try. "
"rperkman","Everything works as intended, great explanations, thank you and good luck!"
"rperkman","Interesting project, thank you for explaining. Your Code looks clean and fine:)"
"rperkman","Good job! The code is very well explained! :)"
"rperkman","Good Job! Keep Going^.^ Nice explanation and beautiful code."
"rperkman","Nice job, Drops the required results, definitely :)"
"rperkman","good work, can explain the code and the code works also well, congratulate, no problem found, good luck for next one. "
"rperkman","Very good project, knew everything he should about the exercises he has done, no mistakes found, good work! :)"
"rperkman","He explained well, everything looks good! Good luck:)"
"rperkman","Nice very readable program and good explanation. "
"rperkman","Good job. Phonebook works fine and as it should concerning the subject. Nice and clean solution. Good luck with the next CPP projects!"
"rperkman","The Project seems to work perfectly, however one if statement did not have the correct arguments in it, causing the ADD Command in exercise 01 to not behave correctly, not allowing for the adding of any Contracts."
"rperkman","Solid work, exercises are covering the basic asked for functionalities. Couple of bugs as displaying empty fields and truncating of Non ASCII chars didn't work as expected. But all in all good work. Good luck further on!"
"rperkman","As my knowledge goes i think it was outstanding work and everything worked very well , evaluators explained everything and showed every step of the project how should it work"
"rperkman","Such a cool and crazy project! Both of them were so friendly and also helped me understand all of the new stuff that I will have to use later. Good luck!"
"rperkman","Outstanding project, especially the bonus part, every part was explained in detail and there were no errors. Keep up the amazing work and thank you for explaining the project in an understandable way!"
"rperkman","Good work. Knows his stuff. Good luck :)"
"rperkman","great job ! explained well everything ! even helped me with my current project Fract-ol ! thank you for your time ! good luck for the future project ! "
"rperkman","The assignment said do the levels in 15min... He did it in 3min... I think that already says it all, but he definitely knows what he's doing in this project! Gets a thumb up from me! Keep up the speedruns >w> "
"rperkman","nicely done, all tests worked, both explained well parts of the code that i asked, good luck!"
"rperkman","good job, every think work with out problem, he understand his code well, good explain , good luck with next project"
"rperkman","this project is a heavy one and quite a challange for everyone and they did a great job as a team! We tested their minishell and it worked just as the bash does! They explained their approach and the basic structure of the project. Thanks a lot for the amazing explaining and good luck! :)"
"rperkman","Very nice code and very well explained, everything is working as required. Thank you for taking your time to explain!"
"rperkman","very well done, it seems to be a completely new subject with the threads, but he explained it very well! thanks for that! :) good luck!"
"rperkman","Very well done project, all tests passed and there were no leaks, explained everything as well. One small error when one philosopher dies the output says philonumber-1 instead of the philos number, just a +1 in the printf and its good. Good job and good luck for he next projects!"
"rperkman","Good philosophers, good explains, unfortunately some little problems:
 - Not compiling with the flags -> Unused variable
 - Leaks -> init -> check of input
 - You could try to find a good way to protect your threads creation
 - You could maybe try to reorganize your files, it might be confusing for you later if they are called sim1, sim2, etc...

 Except that everything is good, good job and have a nice day :)"
"rperkman","Unfortunately, mallocs in init_philos (init.c) are left unprotected, which leads to segfaults in case of failure.
 Otherwise evrything is working great and Roman knows what he is talking about:))
 Good luck for minihell >_<"
"rperkman","Very solid and clean code, all of the edge cases are protected, the timing is really solid as well. All the test cases from the subject and evaluation page are passed, I really like it. Unfortunately, there are some race conditions, that are not really good:( I am sure you will manage it, good luck with it!"
"rperkman","Good code and well explained, tested many cases ,also with valgrind."
"rperkman","Great job we tested this 😇 ^^"
"rperkman","Everything looks great (no .pdf file in repo). As in prev evaluation, client can take the Max_Int as parameter and it doesnt crash the program, but peer could fix it. Good luck in next projects!"
"rperkman","Looks very good and clean! He could explain it very well and also did all of the bonus! Good job! :)"
"rperkman","Great job! He explained his code very well and was polite and friendly. Client could take Overflow of Max_Int as argument, but it does not affect of how the function works. Also client is protected of negative PID. Sadly i should fail you only because of .pdf file in your'e repo. Good luck next time!"
"rperkman","Good job but you are not printing the whole string but char by char .. I am sorry"
"rperkman","good work but he print char for char and dosen't print the whole string ...good Luck"
"rperkman","Sehr schöner code! Hat Spaß gemacht es errklärt zubbekommen."
"rperkman","Good job. Try fixing your error handling and you'll be good. Good luck :) "

"rperkman","well done. good explanations!"
"rperkman","Nice work, he claims that it is outstanding but I would say good project :)"
"rperkman","Roman explained his code very well. Malloc and read seem to be fine."
"rperkman","Error in the return_value: Case: printing out an unsupported flag (also not supported flag from original printf) ""%y"", his output is like original ""%y"" but his return value is only 1; compared to original printf 2. Otherwise everthing works fine, clean and well structured code."
"rperkman","Everything alright. Small mistakes fixed and explained well. Well done!"
"rperkman","Great job, very clean code!"
"rperkman","very small mistake in the last bonus exercise, otherwise great work! good luck with moulinette!"

"rperkman","Wonderful work, great code. not hard to understand at allll"
"rperkman","Looks good, good luck at the exam."
"rperkman","Thanks for sharing the code. For your next projects check the Makefile it shoul compile only once and again only the c file that has been changed into a new object and the link all files together- Check also the norm rules about them. Do not forget to write errors on the error output.  and some cases are not handled correctly. When using functions check if you should protect them or not. Do not hesitate to use structs to pass your argument. Nice chat and good luck for the end of the piscine."
"rperkman","Great work and explanation!"
"rperkman","everything works! good work"
"rperkman","very nice and friendly. knows his work, could explain everything. unfortunately small error in ex00 (argc not used). Good work. Keep it up!"

"sgiochal","That's a really good job for a 2 days rush, the team worked in a well way on this project, every member know well their part, the explains were also good :) Good job!

 I don't have that much to say, good that you haven't hardcoded anything for the images, you are able to display every types of images that are hidden in the files, nice! Only thing that I could say is that you shouldn't use flags in your Makefile that will alterate your code like debug flag which will add dummy symbols or optimisation flags that might change some behaviour in your code (by example replacing your functions)

 Have a nice day!"
"sgiochal","Really cool project! I think coolest solution for this rush, very professional looking, you got all the colors right & display all images, really impressive. Thanks for explanation."
"sgiochal","you guys did everything, just minor problem with the split if the string to cut is empty there is no error message if the string to cut is empty. and for Mandel you can input the size and there is an output so 2 / 5 points. see you in the next rush."
"sgiochal","Hello,

 WOW, you were one of the few teams, which did not give up! Be proud of yourself, `yasl` is not an easy Rush, and you managed to even come to the mandatory part, very cool!

 Of course some of the code could be improved readability wise, but you had only like 2 days to learn yasl, my code looks the same :P

 Your `yasl_interactive` is only one line?!?! That's crazy

 Have fun and good luck with your next eval."
"sgiochal","Great work and thank you for the information:)"
"sgiochal","Everything works as expected, The bitcoin exchanger calculates the values correct and error handling is done really good, RPN works also as expected and the FJ algorithm was explained well and sorts the numbers. Different containers are user everywhere!"
"sgiochal","All programs work as they should. Handled errors specifically well and explained a lot how his code for each exercise work and why he chose specific containers. Thank you very much for all the explanations. Good luck!"

"sgiochal","Such a cool and crazy project! Both of them were so friendly and also helped me understand all of the new stuff that I will have to use later. Good luck!"
"sgiochal","Outstanding project, especially the bonus part, every part was explained in detail and there were no errors. Keep up the amazing work and thank you for explaining the project in an understandable way!"
"sgiochal","Hey, looks great.

 The code of the tester is written in an easy and understandable way.
 In theory you do not need a separate handler for the `SIGALRM` since by default it will exit the program.

 The handling of the tests is good over all but I personally would have preferred more implicit handling for logging to files and `stdout`.

 (= ФェФ=)"
"sgiochal","Well done rush, everything works as expected in the subject. Evaluation sheet is not clear, some requirements are different from subject, fe: real-tests and tests folder etc. IMO, well done, everything works as expected in the subject, keep it up!"

"sgiochal","Very nice wordle, love the winning/losing sounds very cool idea. also did you know that Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists."
"sgiochal","Explain the mechanism very well, thank you for explain me a lot."
"sgiochal","This was a lot of fun! I was seriously impressed with the perspective view you built - surprised it's the first time I've actually seen someone simulate a lens in fdf! I love to see it!
 I'd love to get into the whole math of how that works, if you don't mind. Other than that, dismissed. Good work! :D "

"sgiochal","Well done, only a norm error for ft_calloc if it checks without flag -R checkDefine for #define SIZE_MAX (18446744073709551615UL).

"sgiochal","Great work - all 3 pisciners were interested and asked questions even they already know a lot. For the future do not forget to write errors in the error output. You can also mark your functions as static when you will write bigger programs (but you do not have to). Great idea to check the error handling at the beginning of your code. Thanks for your interest and good luck for the next of your piscine!"

"tbenz","Very nice minishell!
 Unfortunately we found a few small issures:
 - strcmp() and strlen() are used (instead of ft_xxx)
 - broken pipe signal with input ""cat | cat | ls""
 - minishell exits when redirecting into a empty filename  (expanded from variable):
 export fname=""""
 echo hello > fname
 ambiguous redirection is handled with inputfiles, but forgot to handle with outputfiles
 So sorry guys, but i am sure you will fix those little issues and get out of mini S-Hell next time ; )"
"tbenz","Well done project, in my opinion the most solid minishell i have ever seen. Lots of cool things are implemented for builtins and solid parsing as well. Unf, we found a couple of small issues that should be easy fixed later:
 export q='""' than -> cat $q gg $q
 echo ""'|""'
 export | export hi
 export qq== than export ee$qq=hi
 Other than that - outstanding. Good luck with resubmition and keep up the good work!"

 echo foo | < Makefile
 We found a possible fix: signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN) once you fork

 Unfortunately there was a crash with memory leak if variable assignment with command not found afterwards happens.
 Example: VAR=123 foo

 Other small things:
 - Heredoc unclosed quote.
 - If PWD is unset, it does not get set again by cd.
 - If PWD is manually set something custom, pwd prints that custom message, not the actual cwd.
 - If PATH=: and then just minishell, it does not execute minishell.

 Great evaluation otherwise, I wish you the best of luck for the next try. You'll do it ! :)"
"tbenz","wonderful work, explained a lot of interesting things about the env_list, multi pipes and redicts, checked no errors, good luck for the last one."
"tbenz","Well done, I did my best, they explained everything. I wish you the best."
"tbenz","First of all: Really good job! The minishell looks very good. Unfortunately there was a small mistake in case of pipe_count == 0. In this situation the shell prints ""exit"" even though it does not exit. That happens for example if a single command (with no pipes) is not found. Besides that everything looks great, I didn't find any memory leaks or segfaults so I'm sure that you'll succeed next time. Good luck! :)"
"tbenz","Great work! We found some errors with heredocs, exit command. there was double free and leaks in exit. Some signals are working incorrectly. Wording in some messages are lacking newline. Other than that this is a very good minishell, they handled a lot. Good luck next time:)"
"tbenz","Very nice Work, Well done. Great teamwork and coordination of the different roles (using github). Great understanding of it aswell. They have led me through everything I asked. And everything works as per sheet. "
"tbenz","Segmentation fault when home is unset and I use cd. variables get expanded in heredoc input."
"tbenz","clean code, thank you for explaining, good luck!"
"tbenz","Very well done. Code is really structered. Thorben knows his code and how to structure the program. Really quick evaluation due to the reason that i already tested his code before. Great work!"
"tbenz","Well done, the code is clear and well structured. All the tests are passed successfully! Also I would like to admit that it prints the messages really fast, and prints the whole string in a time (as it supposed to be), not a char by char! Well done, keep it up!"
"tbenz","Very nice code, there is one little edge case where the checker segfaults but I feel like this is not that important since the rest of the code works perfectly and it is not really a use case in my opinion.
 Thorben explained his algorithm very clearly and I understood everything even though i am a radix fraud
 Thanks for your time and good luck for the exam:)"
"tbenz","yep, very clean code, gl with the next evaluations!"
"tbenz","Awesome implementation well understood and explained. very fast sorting and all error returns correct. checker functions as expected. The evaluation is over. But the memories will last a lifetime..."
"tbenz","code generally works well. very fast! rules are complied, clean structure, only thing as he mentioned before eval, when long string is interrupted while sending from client - following message does not load to server. Keep up the good work! good luck"
"tbenz","There is a problem with pid handling, The rest seems to be working. So sorry to fail"
"tbenz","Looks good, the code is clean and he was able to explain everything he has done."
"tbenz","Very nice project, meets all requirements. Thank you for explaining your code and your logic, now i feel like i might finish this project as well (in the distant future). Sadly there was one tiny mistake with the bonus part (it displays error instead of giving back the prompt), but otherwise bonus is also very well done!"
"tbenz","Makefile doesn't create object files and doesn't update executable if the src files were changed. Otherwise we found a valgrind error concerning uninitialized values. Tested error handling. Found no leaks. Other than that very nice prject. Super efficient sorting algorithm. Good luck during your next eval"
"tbenz","Thank you! It was the most interesting evaluation so far. Everything worked fine, it was fun :)"
"tbenz","Great explanation and nice code. I liked the enemies:)"
"tbenz","Outstanding project! Great graphics and creative design. Works very well. Performance is very good and works great."
"tbenz","Everything worked as expected, sadly his sudo.log file is in a different directory thus not complying with the subject. Even his bonus works flawlessly! Keep it up."
"tbenz","Thorben, thanks for the detailed and thorough explanation. I asked many questions and the answers were all very satisfying. Looking forward for more evals with you. Thanks and good luck! :)"
"tbenz","Thank you for explaining me! Great work and help! Was a pleasure! :)"
"tbenz","Thanks for the explanation of your work. It was a very nice evaluation session. "
"tbenz","Good work and explanations, unfortunate small mistake in password policy! Good luck"
"tbenz","Great work, very clean and readable code, very nice job Thorben :D"
"tbenz","Printf without bonuses showed the perfect behaviour and succesful accomplishment of test thrown at it. Code was clear to read and understand, the file management was on point as well. Fairly enjoyed the work and the evaluation itself. Good luck!"
"tbenz","All tests passed, Congratulations:))"
"tbenz","Great job, easily readable code, no logic or memory errors found, bonus also checks out. Keep on keepin' on!"
"tbenz","great eval, he explained his work very well and helped me understand the project. nice guy, good luck:)"
"tbenz","thanks for explanation"
"tbenz","very nice and friendly! Very well written code. Very good explained. Thank you for all the input."
"tbenz","Very well done - he proved that he did the project by himself and could explain it very well. Also I could learn some things from the bonus part - thank you and good lack for the next projects! :)"
"tbenz","Very good project! Not without flaws but very decent. I would recommend to read carefully the whole subject next time, especially the part about compilation but since it's the first project and the mistakes were minor I decided to pass the project. There was a part in ft_calloc which perplexed me (the overflow check was not '!=' bit only in one direction) but I wasn't able to cause the overflow so everything should be fine. Thank you for being patient and giving time to check things and good luck with Moulinette and the next projects!"
"tbenz","everything worked fine, good coding and explained everything"
"tbenz","Overall the code looks good. Sadly he forgot the main function in ex04 :/"
"tbenz","Sadly main wasn't commented out, but there is always a next time"
"tbenz","Good work, all exercises checked. He understand all codes very well."
"tbenz","Well done and well explained - this guy knows his code"
"tbenz","nice guy, looks good :D"
"tbenz","Good explanations, was a bit hard to understand the tasks as it would've taken me some time to fully understand the exercise. But norm checked out and he could explain everything well! GL:)"

"vfrants","Vitaly did really good job, even thought i didn't know much about this project he explained every single detail really well and i could follow up. We went trhough every case in eval sheet and he explained everything. We encounter only one small issue that new version of adminier was realeased in between previus evaluation and this one, and now it requirers not secured connection for downloading. But he was able to figure out the issue and resolve it and explain so we agree on that one."
"vfrants","Awesome project vitali! thanks for explaining everything tome. I know it took long, but you really put a lot of effort in your project and in your explanations. Well done man!
 Good luck in the next evaluations, and see you around!

 All the yasl code looks like from a professional I especially like the `extract_number` function, every possible case is handled.
 Also had a Makefile for preparing all the files and for testing the `display_b64` that's cool.

 Good luck with your other projects and I hope that the next Rush will not be some yasl stuff again. 👨🔫"

"vfrants","Hey, the Rush looks good. Everything is appearing to work and the tester is actually forking, what a surprise.

 The code is short and concise, so not much wrong to do. I guess Minishell helps a lot there.

Maybe I will ask you to play your game more often. ;) I liked the possibility to let the AI play against each other. Amazing! Only ~820 norminette errors (you could do better). Since I won 2 games and lost just one ==> outstanding project!"

"vfrants","the philosophers eat, think, sleap and die. what a boring life. In contrast with this evaluation. I liked the explanations and the code was really interesting. By the way. Socrates  was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as the founder of Western philosophy and among the first moral philosophers of the ethical tradition of thought. An enigmatic figure, Socrates authored no texts and is known mainly through the posthumous accounts of classical writers, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. These accounts are written as dialogues, in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine a subject in the style of question and answer."

"vfrants","Thank you for explaining me your code :) i've learnt a lot (although memorizing will be difficult) wish you good luck"
"vfrants","Great team and great teamwork. Both teammates know the code and explained it very well. Very interesting discussion about your code and why you choose this way. I am very happy that you used a binary tree  because we used a different way. Thank you very much! Outstanding! "
"vfrants","Very great Project ! was rly impressed with the result of their work! Both could explain very well what they did. As their is just yes or no for the last text -> they had 1.996 ! Very well work - Thanks for the explanations! Gl with next evals"
"vfrants","Looks great - thank you for taking your time to explain everything properly!"
"vfrants","Great work, it's a really clean implementation of minitalk :) we went through all the points together, Vitalii gave really detailled (and easy to follow) explanations of his code, .... and it was all good! Good luck with the last eval and the next projects! Thanks for the nice talk."
"vfrants","I tried my best to break it but did  not manage to do so:( sad day
 Anyways, works fine all is good."
"vfrants","Very good job, explained everything well. I undertand a lot more now. good luck :)"
"vfrants","Great explanation, great code, Maybe someday I will understand it too :-)"
"vfrants","super friendly and nice! Awesome work! Very well written and clean code. Thank you for explaining everything and answering all my questions. I learned a lot, even how to break a whole computer :). You are a great coder. Keep it up! Thank you!"
"vfrants","Great Project, very well thought out and very long explanations so even I could understand it, just a simple mistake with the Makefile as it seems, good luck. "
"vfrants","Good job, pretty stable took many youtube videos to take it down. Overall pretty solid, sadly makefile relinks.

 GJ on the projects"
"vfrants","Thanks for explanation, great project, everything works according to requirements)
 Good Luck))
 "

"vfrants","Nice work. Looks like everything is correct. Well done! garniy proekt"
"vfrants","everything working perfectly , code are very clean , explained everything in detail, work exactly like default print function "
"vfrants","Great explanations, clean code, everything runs as intended."
"vfrants","Great code. Everything works fine and as the original function. Good luck. :)"
"vfrants","Great job! Go through the hole code and explained everything very well and step by step. !
 Thanks for the evaluation and good luck for the next projects ;) "
"vfrants","Wow very nice project code is very clean and peer also understand the code. Good luck with next Project's)"
"vfrants","Everything looks good, passed all test, explained well. Fixed leaks from last time."
"vfrants","Great coding with creative tricks. He knows what he is doing. Great guy. Good luck with the wrong previous evaluation. "
"vfrants","great job, clean code!"
"vfrants","Great project, thank you for walking me through the bonus part:)"
"vfrants","Overall very nice project and great approach. Sadly some leaks when reading from the stdin. Everything else works perfectly, so should be an easy fix."
"vfrants","Great job! Everything works as it should and he was able to explain his code with ease. I learned a lot during this evaluation, thanks and good look for the upcoming projects! :)"
"vfrants","Didn't protect read in one function. Sorry for it bro("
"vfrants","Great project!
 Ok for franc, so should be ok for moul.
 GL further! Great guy!"
"vfrants","really great explanations. Functions are clear. Just check in the future for NULL as arguments but else I could not find any issues. Great job!!"
"vfrants","Looks good, all important tests are passing and looks like the moulinette mistakes have been addressed. Keep it up! I hope that this time the tests pass .-."
"vfrants","good job! but unfortunately there were some Issues. he knows how to fix it!

 ft_putnbr_fd(-2147483648, 2); had
 write(fd, ""-2147483648"", 12); instead  write(fd, ""-2147483648"", 11);

 ft_memmove(((void*)0), ((void*)0), 5);
 Segfaulted, because following was missing
 if (dst == NULL || src == NULL) return NULL;

 ft_strnstr(""fake"", ((void*)0), 3); should segfault, but did not

 ft_strnstr(""abcdef"", ""abcdefghijklmnop"", max); output was wrong and not same as original strnstr"
"vfrants","Thank you for your time"
"vfrants","You're doing great work, keep it up this way!
 You know extremely well what you are doing and are able to explain it in a manner that is easy to understand. Thank you for taking the time to walk me through your code! "
"vfrants","unfortunate"
"vfrants","unfortunate crashes and leaks"
"vfrants","Even do they could explain everything well, sadly malloc failed :( "
"vfrants","Student had very deep knowledge about exercises. Very informative and nice learning experience for me. Good Luck!"
"vfrants","perfect guy explain a lot ! knows perfect ! great job!"
"vfrants","the best guy on piscine, wish you goodluck"
"vfrants","He was able to give me a really good explanation of what he was coding. and what his code is going to do. Nice guy. Keep up the good work. "
"vfrants","NICE WORK"
"vfrants","Good guy, can explain everything :)"
"vfrants","good work :)"
"vfrants","Good work, and could explain it well as well, good job"
"vfrants","very friendly guy, explained every ex. really well :))"
"vfrants","Great guy and awesome work - hope mulinette sees it the same way"
"vfrants","Looks good, very nice explanation good luck"
"vfrants","nice code, well explained :)"
"vfrants","Great work! Friendly guy explained everything in detail as have not completed it . Keep it Up!"
"vfrants","Very clean code! Very fast! Explained me the code! friendly guy! "
"vfrants","Good work! Thanks man!"
"vfrants","Code looks good. last 2 exercises not completed but should be okay. Good job!"
"vfrants","everything worked. great guy))"
"vfrants","good work. all exercises checked and he know good all the codes."
"vfrants","Nice , looks good . great job :D"
"vfrants","everything works well, explained it perfectly :)"
"vfrants","The code demonstrates a good understanding of C programming concepts and the theory behind the game of Skyscrapers. The implementation is quite clean, with no obvious memory leaks, and the logic for solving the puzzle is generally sound. However, the code does have limitations. It appears to work correctly only up to a map size of 6x6.
 Good job!"
"vfrants","Authentic work, EXTREMELY  good explanations, thank you!"
"vfrants","Great evaluation. He know very well his code. The explications was very interesting. Good work. "
"vfrants","he explained all the information thoroughly, I enjoyed learning from him :D"
"vfrants","all good!"
"vfrants","Great explanation. Good job. Keep it up :)"
"vfrants","thank you so much, I learned something!"
"vfrants","Looks good!! He expalined well:)"
"vfrants","Great Work! All exercises worked in the way they should. Vitalik understood the problems and was able to explain them perfectly!"
"vfrants","he was very friendly, he explained everything thoroughly, i really enjoyed the evaluation."
"vfrants","very good explanations, he understands exactly what he is doing.
 great job :)"
"vfrants","great understanding of the code, great code itself, nicely done"
"vfrants","Very nice work and clever code"
"vfrants","great person with thorough understanding.
 I see a great future for him::)"
"vfrants","Very kind, excelent explanations, very patient. There was only a variabel undeclaired, rest would be working."
"vfrants","very good job! good explanations!"
"vfrants","Great work. Very good understanding and explanations."
"vfrants","ex06, you should eliminate the last comma.
 Really good understanding of fundamentals, logical operations and recursive functions. well done and keep up the good work."
"vfrants","Great explanations, really knows how to do things and found innovative solutions. Excellent work! "
"vfrants","Thanks for your explanations. Good work!"
"vfrants","couldnt find anz mistakes, nice and clean code"
"vhappenh","very nice and friendly. A very interesting project, which works at it should. You explained your work very thoroughly and answered every question I had. I learned a lot. Thank you very much and BeReal."
"vhappenh","He was very into the project. The code and the website look good. Things shouldnt be happened based on the evaluation sheet, didnt occur. During the evalution, he was able to answer all of my questions! Well done!!! If I have questions for this project in the future hope you still can help me haha"
"vhappenh","Wonderful explanation, well done!! :3 Great work!"
"vhappenh","Thanks for the introduction to dockers, the project requires a lot of checks. Unfortunately it seemed like the port restrictions didnt fulfill the requirements. Surely it will work out next time :)"
"vhappenh","Very nice! Everything was explained excellently and works as intended. I would suggest to paint more meaningful error messages on the screen and delete not needed parts of the code. I had the feeling that much time and thought was invested in these exercises. Radical!"
"vhappenh","Thanks a lot for taking your time for showing the project and the nice explanations. It will help me a lot!!!!"
"vhappenh","nicely done, could not find anything strange or not working.. In the last exercise we can handle duplicates or triplets and so on... Great work .. Good luck with exam!!"
"vhappenh","Everything looked really nicely written and ran as it was supposed to but at the last exercise if we had triples or more (ex. 1 1 1 2, 1 1 1 1 2 etc) the code would be stuck in an infinite loop. Good luck next time :) "
"vhappenh","nice chat with Valerian as always, ford johnson implemented as it should be, error handling in ex00 and ex01 was done nicely. Really good explanations , good luck with exammm !!! "
"vhappenh","nice work everything works as expected but some error massages are a bit misleading in the RPN but they were especially good in the Bitcoin exchange overall nicely done :)"
"vhappenh","everything is clear, explained all he did, and answered my questions, code also worked well, good job. "
"vhappenh","Looks good. I think everything works as expected, also tested some edge case, but he has taken that into account and nothing breaks."
"vhappenh","very clean code and everything is nicely implemented. good job! good luck with the next module :)"
"vhappenh","Well explained everything - even if I didn't work with cpp he could explain everything properly. Tests with the ex.. files worked properly. Great work!"
"vhappenh","looks like a very well thought throw Project I wasn't able to find any bugs.
 Keep up the good work and have fun :)
 :*"
"vhappenh","Code looks good. Well explained, even though it was my first time seeing c++, I understood it. Thanks and well done!"
"vhappenh","Sadly a small mistake regarding a number with an f (for float) at the end e.g. 42f or 42.0f. Except of that great job! Im sowy D:"
"vhappenh","funny workaround for ex02, but should have used  a try catch block. other than that good job!"
"vhappenh","Wow, that was a workload. Thank you for explaining to me what awaits, I can't say that I'm looking forward to it... Otherwise we tested everything (to my knowledge) and checked for leaks as well. Good job! :)"
"vhappenh","We went through all exercises and discussed all implementations, unfortunately the exectuteForm did not check for form to be signed. Good luck with next submission!:) "
"vhappenh","great project! went over the eval sheet. everything works the way its meant to be. :)
 good luck in the next circle"
"vhappenh","Code nicely written, everything seems to be working as the subject and eval sheet requires it. Good job :) ! "
"vhappenh","Great work! The fds are protected now:) Checked with different maps and and configs, all runs smooth and responsive. No memory leaks detected and funcheck was passed. Good luck:)"
"vhappenh","Great job! The animations were smooth and the picture was astonishing, however, fd leaks were present(didnot close before exit). Otherwise, good job! Good luck :)"
"vhappenh","nice project, error handling has proven to be resilient with charming messages. The handmade wall textures were lovely. Image processing was stable and fluent, key actions concurred with expectations, memory usage showed to be constant without any peaks. They could explain their code nicely and thoroughly. Well done!"
"vhappenh","He did very well! Even had 6 minute left"
"vhappenh","Great job, everything looked fine. I'm glad you're no longer relying on using default for all routing tables. So yeah, let's see if I can grow up to this challenge now. Good luck with quebbd!!!!"
"vhappenh","everything went well, was able to solve all levels in less than ten minutes and knew the necessary terminology. well done"
"vhappenh","everything that was wrong yesterday was fixed and some improvements were made. No leaks or crashes everything was as it should be every const was also where it should be. Nice work"
"vhappenh","Good job, everything looks fine to me and worked perfectly! "
"vhappenh","unfortunately you forgot the virtual destructor in the ex00; this went unnoticed because of the missing delete in the main function. otherwise everything was working as intended. Sry :("
"vhappenh","Really good explains, everything is working properly, concept of inheritance have been correctly understood, good job!

 Unfortunately some little problems in the ex03:
 - Values are overloaded by the ScavTrap when the FragTrap is instanced
 - Name is not correctly displayed in the whoAmI member function

 PS: Don't forget to add some colors in your main to make them more readable for the evaluators, it's easier to explain some specific stuff with a beautiful main :D Also don't hesitate to take a look in #pragma once and to check about dependencies in makefile (flags MMD, MP and .d files)

 Good luck for the rest of the CPP Piscine!!"
"vhappenh","Good job! Explained the code to me very well. Went through it all. Unfortunately, the clapTrap Name doesn't have / show the suffix its supposed to be. Crossing fingers for the upcoming evaluations!"
"vhappenh","Great work, very well explained allthough I had no idea of cpp he was able to explain to me very well. good luck for your further projects."
"vhappenh","Everything seems like working, MOREOVER working right:-) Makefiles r short which is good for me i guess , headers r easy to understand. Every integer was explained, every class, every line.. sooo long.. But is finally over>_< Good job!"
"vhappenh","Good job on this project. well done!"
"vhappenh","nice work << operator was not correctly done as it output to cout and not the ostream& of the parameterlist, still very nice implementation"
"vhappenh","Great job!! Explained everything very thoroughly and so that I could understand it very well. Thank you for making me learn a lot ;) "
"vhappenh","Nice work, he could explain me everything and awnser my question. Good luck for the Future:)"
"vhappenh","That's a good project! There were some flaws which did not affect how a user interacted with the program: exit code of 1 if ctrl d is used, exit is part of a class (a method) and not a function, not the same choice of int or bool returned by functions/methods, alll files are in src folder while I am used to src and inc separation. Otherwise, well done!"
"vhappenh","very nice projects. everything worked as asked in the subject. He even implemented some more features. well done."
"vhappenh","Everything was working and well explained. Unfortunately a minor mistake didn´t let the program print the phone book correctly after adding the 8th contact. In any case good job and good luck for the next trial! "
"vhappenh","Thank you now I know how to use the friend Keyword xD! Sadly we are not allowed to use that Keyword! Otherwise a really nice code! You could explain everything what you did! Thanks and good luck next time!  "
"vhappenh","Everything works as intended, there are no leaks, and the code is clean, with all the necessary protections etc. Nicely done"
"vhappenh","Explained everything in detail and the program works as it should (every test case was correct). Good luck!"
"vhappenh","Very clean code and great explanations. i couldnt find any mistakes. well done and good luck with the next evals ! :D"
"vhappenh","Nice work. Everything worked as expected. They could explain everything to me and guides me through the evaluation. Helped me understand the project!"
"vhappenh","I think its outstanding! the guys did a really good work! explanations were excellent . everything worked as expected and I had quick overview of the code. Good luck for the next one ! :)"
"vhappenh","I believe that the third time is the charm, and going through the whole evaluation sheet I figure it might be true. Found no leaks, and no weird behaviors.  Built-ins seemed to work correctly, they even implemented some stuff that I consider very EXTRA. I tested everything the evaluation sheet asked and more. Code looked a bit messy but they can explain everything. I'll come back when I need help, they seem like they knew what they were doing. Good luck!"
"vhappenh","Nice try! A lot of stuff works as expected but after i tried do stuff with brackets ""()"" minishell brokes up. Also it crashed after pipes or redirection in a rows like ""|||"", "">>>"". And please be careful with the files in the repository, there should be only files that mentions in subject! (do not forget about hiddenfiles)
 Good luck next time and do not give up!"
"vhappenh","well done! everything tested manually and with tester. they both could explain very well. good job!"
"vhappenh","overall very good work - unfortunately the string splitting with redirections didnt work with no spaces 'echo shdg>test' for example and 'cat|cat|ls' doesnt terminate after second cat input everything else worked fine - thanks for showing me the project!! "
"vhappenh","Very Cool Project. The team had excellent knowledge and could explain everything really well. Happy Coding :)"
"vhappenh","Great to see this project in detail, I like the implementation and the visuals. Of course no norminette and valgrind issues, he did well with the input handling (especially liked the triple pointer) and all in all a good project. Good luck with Minishell :)"
"vhappenh","tested with everything I could think of as well as everything that was required on the evaluation sheet. Norminette didn't complain and neither did valgrind in every scenario... Overall very nice. Colours are very flashy"
"vhappenh","everything perfect, in thin revised version he corrected some minor mistakes. good job"
"vhappenh","sadly when I pressed X it had an invalid read what was strange because it did the same in the code as esc and still behaved differently! "
"vhappenh","That's was good work, but one parameter was with higher value and program don't wanna display some maps correctly. Very sad, but I hope next time problem would be solved. I wish him luck and power for this and next projects! "
"vhappenh","Norminette error on the header file but code is good and it works!"
"vhappenh","great work! we checked everything very thoroughly, passed all the required tests (sorry Luca). Bonus part also partly done and super crazy, love the color schemes. No memory leaks. Nice! So long and thanks for all the fish. "
"vhappenh","We discussed his implementation of the project; he showed a good understanding of how the signals work and could explain his reasons for using a specific funciton. Everything works as it should and it didn't crash - yay!"
"vhappenh","Great job, beautiful code. Perfectly explained! I had fun evaluating it;)"
"vhappenh","Okay, apparently he needed to improve his code because he printed wrong characters after occupying the pc by opening youtube or whatnot (lack of handshake). I thought that was not needed for the mandatory part, but okay. Now it's all fixed and works, even when resending the signals his server prints out the correct messages. Emojis are also handled, what a ball. He is a bit rude when you're trying to write a thorough evaluation review but all fine, we like him."
"vhappenh","i am very sorry, but no handshake and a usleep of 300 is too low :( either increase usleep (which is the lazy version ;P) or implement a handshake :)) "
"vhappenh","in my opinion an outstanding project! :) very well explained! last bonus is missing."
"vhappenh","Okay thanks for trying to explain what you did, overall it was well executed, presented and defended. Even can send emojis, and prints all different lengths of text. The bitshifting works, and the code is surprisingly short. Maybe I'll do this one next :)
 Norminette and my tests all checked out as well. "
"vhappenh","very well done, no leaks, classic radix implementation, talked a bit more about sort 5, had a similar approach :)) "
"vhappenh","Nice evaluation, everything runs properly . Good job :) "
"vhappenh","It was really well explained, and honestly presented what was wrong last time and how he fixed it. Tahnk you so much for your time! :)"
"vhappenh","Thank you for taking the time to explain your project in detail. Good luck!"
"vhappenh","Good work! Knew how to test this stuff very profound! Explained the flow of the code very well. I like him! :)"
"vhappenh","His beautiful code was explained to me twice and passed all my tests. Great job!"
"vhappenh","Very good! Has a deep understanding of the system and it's commands as well as the underlying functionality. It was a pleasure! :D"
"vhappenh","Great work! You could explain everything and everything worked as expected!"
"vhappenh","nicely explained. i can finaly finish my own project. thank you."
"vhappenh","Good knowledge about his code and good talking about it. Thx! :)"
"vhappenh","Awesomely done! Not that fun as would be with bonus but still, good job>_<"
"vhappenh","Very nice code. Everything well explained"
"vhappenh","Very nice project. Was able to explain all the details."
"vhappenh","everything well done, the code was clean and good to read, though the names of the variables and functions were a bit hard to understand in the context. good luck with moulinette"
"vhappenh","Valerian didn't want me to press Outstanding project so i didn't :-)!!
 Seems Perfect to me!!!"
"vhappenh","great code - short and straight to the point - easy to understand."
"vhappenh","everything perfect, code looks clean and neat, well done. good luck with moulinette :)"
"vhappenh","outstanding work very well explained very clean code bravo

"vhappenh","Nice Work, really good :-D "
"vhappenh","GJ!"
"vhappenh","change the name of ex00 file, and some to fix in the function."
"vhappenh","great work and nice explainations!"
"vhappenh","Great work :))"
"vhappenh","nice"
"vhappenh","GJ!"
"vhappenh","thx - explained it well!"
"vhappenh","thank you for explaining your exercises, very interesting!"
"vhappenh","Minor bug fixed, yeaiiii"
"vhappenh","Great explanations, too much for my brain tho :c"
"vhappenh","great work! nice code, understandable and can explain everything"
"vhappenh","sorry, great code, but forgot to add the library, very small mistake but sad its on the ex01 :( next one will be fine im sure!!! good luck :) "
"vhappenh","very nice guy, just forgot to include his unistd :("
"vhappenh","could explained what he did wrong the last time and fixed his mistakes. good job, looks good to me. "
"vhappenh","very nice guy, explained his code :)"
"vhappenh","great work very good, good luck"
"vhappenh","Nice work! ex01 seems a bit wackelig. Good luck :)"
"vhappenh","great explanation, gave me some great input and different approaches to finish the exercises! "
"vhappenh","let's hope together!!!"
"vhappenh","Your project was not finish but you try to make your maximum and you too many goods ideas. Good luck!!"
"vhappenh","code looks good, except type mistake in  ex01!"
"vhappenh","good!"
"vhappenh","everything executes well, moulinette should give 100"
"vhappenh","nett und freundlich und hilfbereit:)"
"vhappenh","ex06 output starts with second line and skips than every second line. Should start with first line. The other things were good. "
"vhappenh","friendly and cooperative, well explained! :)"
"vhappenh","This rush works, that's great! Your code is quite clean.
 Please make attention to overflows and infinite loops with max int. And make proper commits too! :)
 The work team is great, and everything seems work. Good job!
 Keep working and good luck for the next exam!"
"vhappenh","Nice code, good explanation. thanks!"
"vhappenh","Very good explained!"
"vhappenh","So nice explanation and very hard work! Good luck! "
"vhappenh","Clearly explanations :) only ex08 is missing"
"vhappenh","all exercises looking good, good luck for your moulinette"
"vhappenh","Nice work. Found no flaws :)"
"vhappenh","Pleasent evaluation!"
"vhappenh","unlucky valerian"
"vharkush","Well done, explained everything to me and everything works as intended. Good luck! :)"
"vharkush","She took her time to explain the code and the point of the exercises. Thank u so muck. and i wish u good luck :)"
"vharkush","Really nice project, the game works as it should and from the parsing and game side, everything looks perfect. Unfortunately I found an invalid read in case the function mlx_new_window() function returns NULL (because after that the mlx_destroy_display is called twice). You know how to fix it and I think there are no other issues with the good. Good luck with the next evaluations!"
"vharkush","Everything looks fine, good explanation, no errors, no leaks. They even did some parts of bonus but unfortunetly no bonus rules/files.  Good luck."
"vharkush","great explanation and work, one of the maps was a little sussy though."
"vharkush","Good job. everything works as expected, the config file is very well handled. good luck:)"
"vharkush","Great Work I must really say. The explained me almost everything in detail. It's clear that they understood everything very very well. They kindly lead me through the process as per my request. I appreciate her showing me stuff that wasn't on the sheet. As per sheet everything worked. No crashes and everything that was supposed to be handled, was handled correctly. Thanks for helping me prepare mentally for the project. Great Teamwork!! Good luck for the next Project."
"vharkush","Thank you for the explanations. Project works well and tested all the project tasks. Good luck on your other eval and projects!"
"vharkush","that was a great experience, thanks for explaining! code works well, is interesting project! Good luck! "
"vharkush","Good project! It was a nice refreshment of my knowledge of the project, Valeriia was able to answer all the questions and was confident in why she wrote the code in the way she did. All the tests passed and edge cases checked. Good luck with the next projects!"
"vharkush","good job. very clean code and could explain everything and showed me arround the program! even provided some extra more critical tests! "
"vharkush","I tested every case that was asked for and all the nasty things I could think of. No leaks, no data races, no deadlocks. Lovely! I also checked the code, but everything seemed protected, the functions more or less logically structured and the names (most of the times) descriptive. Good luck with the rest of your evaluations! (::::::"
"vharkush","Nice project ;D"
"vharkush","Explained everything with ease and seems to have a good understanding of the project. It looks cool and I would definitely play it. "
"vharkush","nice implementation! even drew all the images by herself. I really liked it and it helped me to understand more. good luck for the next ones ! :)"
"vharkush","Very nice project! It's looks beautiful and the monke is very charming. Sadly there are some little leaks - which are really easy to fix :) We looked extensively at the code and talked about her implementation. Personally i would do less recursive fts and not init the monke everytime :D"
"vharkush","Nice project, tomorrow you will pass :)"
"vharkush","Congratulations! you finished push_swap. everything worked as expected. you improved your knowledge and explained your code well. Good luck for the next projects!:)"
"vharkush","Very through explanation, great work!"
"vharkush","great project! I can see that it took a lot of effort and time. loved the function names) good luck with future projects)"
"vharkush","Caught all invalid inputs but printed customized error messages instead of ""Error\n"". Everything besides thats works great and also explained her approach and the code. Good luck!"
"vharkush","Lovely project, works like a charm, love the names, she can explain her code very nicely, great to have had an insight into it!"
"vharkush","Nice chat as always with Valeria. She explained me everything from scratch and we checked how the pipex work . It is fine . Good job . Works as expected . Bonus is done great!"
"vharkush","We checked the project in details and she was able to explain it clearly. Everything seems to work properly. Great Job! Good luck!"
"vharkush","I found some tiny (not so tiny) leaks here and there :( Otherwise she could explain me everything, so that I also understood it for the first time, so thanks for that!
 See you next time! (:"
"vharkush","Great job! Very well explained and very detailed. Thank a lot it helps me in my project!"
"vharkush","Great project, she clearly worked a lot on this. Knows her shell commands well and the theory behind is also explained correctly. Script and signature was perfect, and I was impressed that she even did bonus. The wordpress page has great color schemes, and after a bit of a hiccup even the file transfer was fine through FTP. Now I can look at a photo of myself on this page, can't complain. Very cool indeed!"
"vharkush","I made her feel like a cucumber apparently. lol
 We went through eeeeeeeeverything, took our time and I was trying to be as specific as I can with all of the questions. Everything worked fine and the WordPress website was very minimalistic and stylish. Thanks for your time, as usual! <3"
"vharkush","very good code and nicely explained. good luck with mulinette!"
"vharkush","Everything worked perfect! The bonus of printf seems very complicated with all the special inputs, so good job how you did it!! Good luck for the next project! :)"
"vharkush","I. AM. IMPRESSED.
 We just took hours to get through everything which was on one hand an amazing learning experience, on the other hand completely overwhelming lol. We found some tiny inconveniences in the Makefile and some unnecessary things in the functions but all in all it's astounds me how she did it!
 Thank you soo much for your time, I hope everything passes and that you get all the points you definitely deserve!!! <3"
"vharkush","like the last time every thing was perfect and a very interesting approach with a recursive function!
 And this time even the header was perfect as expected! "
"vharkush","Definitely outstanding as it is implemented recursively which is quite mind boggling and it took me a while to understand it, but when it clicked (btw not only for me xD) it was beautiful! much respect ;)"
"vharkush","The project was solved in unique way, however I'd suggest spending more time refreshing/preping for next evals."
"vharkush","sadly did forget to define BUFFER_SIZE in the Headerfile
 sry :'-("
"vharkush","Random Buffer size in the Header file was forgotten. Valeria already changer it. The first get net line i see with recursive function. Well done. Wish you good luck for the next evaluation"
"vharkush","Clean and nice code! Explained everything so well and knew all the details! And also did you know that the Internet weighs the same as a strawberry: The weight of all the electrons in motion that make up the internet at any one given moment is equivalent to 50 grams. Crazy right?"
"vharkush","know her code really well. help me to explain some of my doubts regarding libft functions. very friendly :)"
"vharkush","I'm speechless...  have never encountered code like this till now, the logic is unique and very special, but it works, so I guess great job :D PS: I like the ass-function"
"vharkush","helped me with lst_delone; nice functions; we talked about our codes - hope this push works :)"
"vharkush","Good work"
"vharkush","Very good explanation of her code. GL- Keep it up. See you in February!"
"vharkush","Good job!"
"vharkush","Great work! She was able to explain everything. Also, her approach to testing the last two exercises is clever"
"vharkush","Very friendly and ready to explain code to newbies. I just tagged along, but still got to understand something new. Definitely deserves a place at 42. Good job so far! ;) "
"vharkush","nicely done!"
"vharkush","clean code ,good work"
"vharkush","You worked well together and the final product, even if not 100% working, is a good achievement. I really think that with slightly more time you could have fixed the bugs and made it almost perfect ;-)
 Next time we'll try that pecan pie and a good dose of adrenaline for me... But also have a look again at those Makefiles, they'll be quite useful in the future!
 Good luck and enjoy your last days of piscine! :))"
"vharkush","Very smart Person :) Explained every detail super nice. Good Luck"
"vharkush","Valerie is the perfect 42 student. She explained every step so well and would have been open for questions on the topic. You can see the hard work behind her code block. BRAVA"

"vharkush","second eval therefore check of ex01 OK; ex09 only partly working
 please stay motivated!!!"
"vharkush","9 didnt work properly, besides that everything looks good :)
 "
"vharkush","Great job, awesome code and logic. Unfortunately included useless files in ex09.  "
"vharkush","you have a great understanding of your code. Sadly there was a hidden file in ex09 and ex011. "
"vharkush","I say that all ist ok, because all shows ok and works."
"vharkush","great piece of work. now it must be right =)"
"vharkush","Deleted the extra line in Ex05. Ex07 does not work for all numbers. Exept that fine work! she could explain every step!
 just took longer  as usual because explanations were needed!
 "
"vharkush","first exercise is wrong. "
"vharkush","Great work! Small mistake in the 7th exercise."
"vharkush","She knew what she had done but she noticed her mistake and said it before I noticed! good luck! :)"
"vharkush","very friendly person, explained everything very very well"
"vharkush","Gl Hf"
"vharkush","Really well done.
 Sadly the code did not compile, but the team was really focused on what they did.
 Please make sure it compiles next time GG. 🐙"
"vharkush","Nicely done, diligent work, great pleasure :)"
"vharkush","Valeria did a really great job defending her code. She is a very funny person where you can see the passion for coding."
"vschneid","Good Explanation and Represantation of all the Tests with various testfiles to showcase all the Cases and Rules."
"vschneid","very clean code, i couldnt spot a single mistake. good job ! good luck with the last eval :)"
"vschneid","thanks for the detailed explaining and the cool d game that you created. I am looking forward to doing it, too. I learned a lot :) "
"vschneid","Unfortunately she used access() to check for availability of her map files which is not part of the allowed functions list. Furthermore the fd is not closed in case of map errors which should be implemented as well. Besides of these points the program looks good, no memory leaks, all checks are performed and the image processing is sound and proof. Nice textures! Good luck next time :)"
"vschneid","The code looks vey good to me, explanation was very thorough and i liked the game :)"
"vschneid","great game, nice details, good explanation:)"
"vschneid","Good job everything works as expected and no memory leaks. She can explain her code very good and she didn’t left any questions without answer, also she explained the radix sort algorithm very carefully.
 Congrats and good luck with  the next project's!"
"vschneid","Great Work, thanks for the explanation. Keep up the good work and good luck"
"vschneid","Viktoria did a great job on her pushswap and was able to make radix even a little bit more efficient. kudos!"
"vschneid","U had a litty bitty mistake. but u know how to fix it real quick! I love you! <3 u can do it!"
"vschneid","code works fine above 5 numbers sorry. No leaks and errors."
"vschneid","looking good. As you just had to fix the header name to include bonus it was a very easy eval. Good luck byeeeeeee"
"vschneid","Viktoria or as I call her ""the Mausi"" is an awesome coder! She is able to explain me step by step every detail of the code. Since I am still working on my gnl  i know now who to ask when I'm stuck! Women empowerment you guys, i not only like Viktoria for her body butt also for her brain."
"vschneid","She already pushed her get next line and she did the extra part (bonus). Great Work :-) "
"vschneid","Printed everything smooth af. Very interesting approach to the bit-shifting. I still have to think about that lol good work and see you next time :)"
"vschneid","great project  - thanks for explaning me the project!"
"vschneid","the code looks good and works good as well so far that I could test. great job! keep coding!"
"vschneid","all ok. unfortunately a small mistake in bonus, header file name was wrong, so the bonus did not compile. good job!"
"vschneid","Wonderful project, your rather creative choice of variable and function names made me sniggle, took a little getting used to but other than that... no complaints from me, I think you deserve these points. Best of luck with the last eval, maybe hüseyin can find something I didn't. Hope he won't, cause that'd reflect badly on me, but... we'll see. Good luck, GG and have fun with your next project. ;)"
"vschneid","Such great work! She explained everything in detail and even had her own main function and text files ready for testing. Code is very clean and variable names were well chosen so that everybody can understand the code without any problem. Good job and good luck for the other evaluations!! <3"
"vschneid","Program worked with basic input and threw out the required Error messages, like the original printf. The return value was also correct. In general very well structured project and clean code. Congrats!!!"
"vschneid","Tested with all the required tests, as well as the test script could not find any difference in the output. Norminette didn't complain either. everything that was stated in the subject as mandatory, performed like the original printf. Overall solid project"
"vschneid","Very good job my love. Every day you amaze me. I liked the way your project is structured, very well readable and easy to understand. This must come from your extensive knowledge of C. Your studies of the old classics have paid off. <3 :-* hdgdl bussi bussi"
"vschneid","Has a good knowledge about the subject, provided a detail answers to all questions."
"vschneid","We went through everything necessary. Step by Step she could explain all the questions. She is definitely ready to become a sysadmin. good luck!"
"vschneid","we went through every step in the evaluation. She explained everything very well and did the commands without having to think about it. she obviously spent quite some time using the commands. bonus was not done. overall very nice project"
"vschneid","Viki explained the Project very good, unfortunately there was a little mistake in the password policy. But you will do better next time for sure. Good luck!"
"vschneid","Just a small mistake in the password policies (the lcredit was missing). Good luck for next time"
"vschneid","everything well explained til sudo but sadly a mistake in sudo-log, couldnt see the command history "
"vschneid","Awesome!"
"vschneid","great code and she explain some of them good job and good luck!"
"vschneid","we checked the Files and tested them with Francinette. the soares tester did not show any errors. we manually checked the substr and strchr and tested them. for the get next line and printf you will need these functions and they should be protected"
"vschneid","Generally explained everything very well, had a couple of memory leaks and an overflow bug in strchr and strrchr. Very friendly, thanks for taking the time to explain your work!"
"vschneid","Viktoria amazes me every time. Totally underrated coder, amazing theorist and fighter."
"vschneid","Code is working, clean and brief, norm compliant, we had more extensive talk about a few functions and hopefully could clear some stuff up, gl with eval! :D"
"vschneid","Good girl "
"vschneid","Clean code, very readable and showed good understanding! Best of luck :)"
"vschneid","Good job!"
"vschneid","clean code, good job."
"vschneid","Excellent job. keep going!!"
"vschneid","She repair the little mistakes, I hope now is all ok. Good luck :)"
"vschneid","The code worked on another OS, but anyway the makefile relinked and there were some memory leaks that we discussed together.
 Next time compile it here :)
 BTW GG

"vschneid","good work, good luck !"
"vschneid","The Team did not finish the work because there was not enough time, they focused on error handling but they cosidered just stings with a length of 31 chars.
 The code compiles properly and there norm is ok.
 And the project is able to solve this case ""4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2""
 Good job, and remember that the users of your code are gonna mess up.

 ex08 => includes the search expression *~* and not *~"
"vschneid","a few minor mistakes but still good job. better luck next time :)"
"vschneid","understood most of what she did, could explain most of it, but the execution (the upload) was very messy, pointed out most of her mistakes"
"vsharma","Nice project, runs smooth even under helgrind, no philos die unless they are supposed to. Code looks clean and understandable. For extra large numbers (cutoff is 214748369, above that) it behaves funny, but its ok for me, i think these cases are not too realistic to test and eval sheet does not ask for it."
"vsharma","great work, the simulation was very fast, even with a large number of philos!
 some suggestions for optimization: cleanup in case of pthread create failure, put files in philo subfolder, possibly protect mutex init, add ""all"" rule to phony, and mutex lock doesn't need protection i think.
 what was rly cool is, that with 4 400 200 200 the program was running even for half an hour, that's quite impressive! "
"vsharma","Great job! Everything works just fine, the philosophers live and die as they are supposed to. If time_to_die is bigger than INT_MAX, it overflows and the philos die after 1 ms. Since it's not specified clearly in the subject and the eval sheet doesn't ask for it as well, I don't see it as an error (since everything else is working perfectly fine!). Also next time use errorcodes > 0 in case of errors (e.g. malloc_error). Good luck for the upcoming evals! :)"
"vsharma","Thank you for showing me your philosophers and explaining it to me!
 Unfortunately during testing we found a leak and also the checking for arguments could be improved:
 gcc instead of cc
 if the number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat is 0: invalid parameter?
 +100 invalid argument
 leak for table structure (free it at program exit)
 i'm sure you will fix the issues swiftly and good luck for the next try!"

"vsharma","Thank you for the explanation. Nice game:)"

"vstockma","Nice project! It was very interesting to see how it works, learned quite a bit. It has all necessary functionalities implemented. They could answer my questions well and knew their code. Good luck with the last eval!"
"vstockma","Cool project! Everything works like stated in the subject. We went through the eval sheet and tried to crash it. But the server was resilient. Many clients, even if they go to sleep and come back didn't interrupt the server. Good stuff! I hope everything else works out - good luck!"
"vstockma","We checked everything from the evaluation sheet went through it and the student explained everything to me. We done required tests. Thanks for the explanations. Good luck with irc!"
"vstockma","Project well explained and Wordpress site looks great. Well done!"
"vstockma","Nice project, good explanation of Docker. GL :)"

"vstockma","Thanks a lot for explaning the module to me. All exercices checked and I could not find errors. Good job and good luck with the last eval :)"
"vstockma","pretty much everything was fine. only a few small things in ex00 and ex02 but nothing dramatic enough to fail someone for I think. "
"vstockma","Job done, it is really nice to see different approach to the span exercise than mine and to learn something new . All works as expected , constant iterators are present! "
"vstockma","Everything worked as far as I could tell! We walked through every exercise, however, I had some trouble following the explanations. Good Luck!:)"
"vstockma","Great job! Explained everything very well! Everything works like it should. Good look for the next project! ;) "
"vstockma","good work, everything worked fine, all the tests went through. good job"
"vstockma","Thanks for showing me the code and the explanations :)
 ex00: The makefile is using the right flags even if CPPFLAGS is used, for some static function a const parameter is not used but it works as well, he implemented char cast working with decimals which is also fine to me. The rounding is different for int with arg -2.9 and -2147483647 but according to eval sheet the spirit is here.
 ex02: maybe there is another way to write the try and catch
 Have fun with the next projects :)"
"vstockma","gut erkläert, alles funktioneiert und sieht nice aus "
"vstockma","Great work, clean code. "

"vstockma","all worked well until the ""concrete brain"" test. Will need to fix this seg fault"
"vstockma","Excellent project. Thanks for walking me through the code and explain the syntax and all this new C+++ stuff. Good luck with your next evaluations! : )"
"vstockma","good job! now that i started cpp modules i actually understand something :D"
"vstockma","There is the achievement ""i have no idea what i'm doing"" and that's pretty much how i felt while doing this eval. CPP has nothing to do with C and it looks so complicated i'm not looking forward to it. But it was not your fault, you have explained everything in detail and helped me understand it better. The project looks nice and it's working in every case."
"vstockma","good work, everything worked fine."
"vstockma","Good Job explained very well and clean code.  "
"vstockma","Very good work, did everything except the last exercise. Still not there at c++, but could understand what the assignment was."
"vstockma","Great work! We went through the code as well as tested bunch of possible cases, all works good. In the bonus mouse movements are slightly inconsistent but other 2 were fine(map and collision). Good luck:) "
"vstockma","Great execution, most of the bonus was working perfectly. Only the movement of the mouse wasn't smooth. Otherwise a great project!"
"vstockma","Game looks functional, all tests passed and the previous mistake was corrected. Well done and good luck!"

"vstockma","works as expected, tested the ctrl + D while waiting for input. all the expected private members in class are private. SEARCH and  ADD commands are working properly and we checked also overwriting the contancts it works.. "
"vstockma","The program crashed when empty lines in cubfile. He already has a solution. good luck with next push "
"vstockma","Program looks pretty nice and works well, but sadly it's possible to crash it by adding many newlines in .cub file. Sorry and gl in fixing it. "
"vstockma","good job! everything handled with a lot of Error cases. tested many cases. Funcheck, env -i, mapchecker from github."

"vstockma","nice and easy explanations, good work!"
"vstockma","nicely done in under 10 min."
"vstockma","Very nice minishell and polite team. We checked all required commands and everything worked as expected. Good luck!"
"vstockma","well structured project, though the naming of the variables in the main struct are a bit hard to follow without explanation or documentation. checked with valgrind and ignore file for readline leaks, no memory leaks found during testing. went through the whole evaluation sheet, couldn't find an apparent problem. they could explain their project and the way they approached it very well, they obviously have a good understanding of bash and how it works. good luck for the remaining evaluations."
"vstockma","everything works, couldn't find any flaws. really outstanding project, they even implemented some Go crazy test inputs. good job!"
"vstockma","Very good Project. Beautifully written. Sadly a little mistake in heredoc, but they can easily fix it. Good Luck next time. Keep Going!^-^"
"vstockma","Good minishell, explains were good, there is some little things that have to be improved:

 - Leaks when you have a permission denied during an execution
 - echo return value is not changed except if you make it do a echo $?
 - echo ""$PWD+$PWD""
 - export test=""s -la"" l$test -> command not found
 - CTRL + C -> heredoc
 - Combination with single/doubles quotes produce leaks -> '""""''
 - Export _ is considered as an not a non-valid identifier
 - ls -l""a"" -> cannot access a

 Good luck for fixing all this! Except that everything is good I think
 PS: Don't hesitate to re-arange your files structure with something a little bit more clear like a folder for the builtins, one for parsing, exec, etc..."
"vstockma","Outstanding project guys!!!! good luck with the next evaluator!!! they explained everything I asked and also the code was clean, easy to read to understand."
"vstockma","good project, the team handled a lot of cases which arent even in the subject and could explain their stuff very well"
"vstockma","Nice minishell. Unfortunately there were some minor mistakes. Some exit codes were not right, unsetting the environment with ""env -i"" lead to weird behavior in some cases (executing ""env"" said path not found, which is weird). SHLVL and PATH wasn't updated when opening new shells or changing directories. Good luck when fixing it and hopefully next time will be better already!
 See you next time, and thanks for your explanations! (:"
"vstockma","there were some issues, they know how to fix it. good luck next time"

"vvilensk","The performance of the searching engine is awesome, for easy: 0.00s, for medium: 0.08s and for hard: 1.02s which is the fastest one searching engine. Sadly, diff for easy case gives negative answer, in case of not found key is called next line of code: write(1, "": Not found.\n"", 14); that prints \0 at the end, and it gives different output:("

From a young age he started collecting code snippets from StackOverflow and copy pasted from GitHub until his time to shine has come. He became a student at 42Vienna where he started using those snippets from back in the day. They all worked until this day and they are working increadibly good. Explained my code very well to me"

"wvan-der","sixth file is missing"
"wvan-der","Level six is missing."
"wvan-der","Very good implementation, one thing to consider:
 use try catch blocks to handle function/keyword failures like new, otherwise the exception is left uncaught and you crash:)
 Otherwise everything looks good and is well understood
 GL"

"wvan-der","Every tests done were working. No leaks and game is ""playable"". I personally have problems with the wall collisions making some movements weird for me and that textures are not scaled so other texture sizes would apper overlapped/cut of. But the guys defended their decisions which was understandable and since nothing like that is mentioned in the subject and eval sheet i think the project is ok."
"wvan-der","Great job, all errors were handled and the files protected, no leaks found. Keep it up, guys! "
"wvan-der","unfortunately a segfault at when all textures are correct and no map inside file :("
"wvan-der","great eval, no leaks , went through the sheet and everything seems smooth
 wish u guys good luck :)"
"wvan-der","Cool project! Renderes smoothly and wall collision is fun. Makefile could be a little bit more sophisticated (like object in folder, and libft as prerequisite. Also look into dependency generation .d files). Also some optimizaitons could be done like dont run around with a copy of file. But overall: good work!"
"wvan-der","We found an issue in the Phonebook, due to the index wrapping logic index 0 is getting skipped (put index++ somewhere else).
 Also when you search with empty PhoneBook you get stuck with no way out except ctrl-C/D
 Other than that, everything looked great and the classes were well structured.
 GL"
"wvan-der","The project look great, but you could put garbage in between the color."
"wvan-der","The program works ok. Everything tested has been passed. The only think is the configuration file, which when miss configured by having double keys, it is not reported. The subject doesn't specify what exactly miss configured mean. They are a good team. Hope you good luck in the future. "

I will not fail because I can not sure that belongs to an error or not.  anyway, the whole is structure and clear and logical. good work."
"wvan-der","The explanation was clear and easy to follow, the code was tested and it worked. Great job and good luck :)"

"wvan-der","Very nice so_long, love the minecraft pictures:))
 Issue from last try (not printing moves on console) is fixed, no leaks, could not make it crash, very good understanding of the code.
 The Process

     make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk
     roll out dough into a large rectangle
     make the butter layer (I have an easy trick for this!!!)
     enclose the butter layer inside the dough
     roll out the dough into another large rectangle, then fold it back together
     roll out the dough again, fold it back together again
     roll out the dough one more time, fold it back together
     shape the croissants
     bake

"wvan-der","Could answer all my question in great detail, maybe small improvement in the monitoring script at sudo-counts: use journcalctl instead of log file counting --> will take sudo cmds before sudoers config in encounter but he could defend his solution, very friendly and polite eval, good luck MAN!"
"wvan-der","The code looks great. Good luck with molinette"
"wvan-der","very good work! He made a huge amount of tests and he knows his code very good."
"wvan-der","Everything works fine, very good work :)"
"wvan-der","Great Work and explanation! It was a pleasure to listen to you :)"
"wvan-der","Creative solutions, function naming could be more descriptive, otherwise great work, very friendly and open discussion about segfaulting or protecting NULLs"
"wvan-der","The code works and looks clean. Well done and good luck!"
"wvan-der","we had a nice discussion about strlen and general library functions, i sadly dont know if u must protect ft_strlen. I liked your defense of your project and your code. It shows that u informed yourself well and understand what u are doing. GL for the next try."
"wvan-der","Everything looks solid here. Cant argue with results. Good work."
"wvan-der","Everything was correct and worked correctly, he explained the code very well.
 Good luck in advance bro. :D"
"wvan-der","everything was fine =). "
"wvan-der","Wilhelm was able to explain the exercises very well, I tested and hope that everything works for moulinette. Very friendly! :)"
"wvan-der","Thanks for sharing the code. For your next projects check the Makefile it shoul compile only once and again only the c file that has been changed into a new object and the link all files together- Check also the norm rules about them. Do not forget to write errors on the error output.  and some cases are not handled correctly. When using functions check if you should protect them or not. Do not hesitate to use structs to pass your argument. Nice chat and good luck for the end of the piscine."
"wvan-der","Great job!"
"wvan-der","Code looks good to me, good luck!"

"wvan-der","Everything good."
"wvan-der","Put in private instead of public SSH-key"
"wvan-der","A small mistake in ex03 private key saved instead of the public one. Otherwise okay."
"xgossing","good job. tested many case with helgrind and without. everything works well. error handling is well."
"xgossing","Nice work! He made sure everything works great. Checked with valgrind/helgrind if there are leaks before the threads are started an there arent any! So good luck with the next projects!"
"xgossing","It was a very nice eval, we went over the code and checked all possible cases, num, letters, empty args, no mem leak, no error in helgrind! Thank you and good luck :)"
"xgossing","this guy did an amazing job. U can see how much time and thought he put into this project. This deserves the name outstanding project for real. Thanks for this experience."
"xgossing","very very nice project, he went a ""little"" overboard. Im betting all my money on his fractol! Explained everything well (for me a normal human a little bit fast but always repeats it if i didnt understand)and was really nice. You can see the fire in his eyes when it comes to fractols. Great job, he a real 42 ambassador."
"xgossing","""Ouhaaa""!!! veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery cool. thanks for showing off :D"
"xgossing","nice code god job,  nice keyboard ;D"

"xgossing","I just wanted to congratulate you on successfully explaining the push_swap project. Your ability to simplify complex concepts and share your knowledge is truly impressive. Wishing you continued success and all the best. Sadly no bonus, but well done! Goodluck"
"xgossing","Good Job. Nice explanation. Keep Going! ^-^"
"xgossing","Very nice. You fixed everything that was sus in your last submission. norminette didn't complain. Tested everything I could think of. Overall very nice work"
"xgossing","great explanations, everything tested. no memory leaks. some thing could be done better, but that are in scope of Minishell. good job!"
"xgossing","Damn. We discussed so much and Xaver gave some great insights into his coding adventures. Loved the Valgrind discussions a lot. Everything works as it should, we tested his pipex very thoroughly. Good job and say hi to your cats pls <3"
"xgossing","sadly used a forbidden function, other than that very clean code. good luck next time!"
"xgossing","So sorry... This is a very nice project overall. very elegantly done. There was only one forbidden function. Xaver even included his own ft_strncmp but unfortunately forgot to exchange the original strncmp with his own... So sad :("
"xgossing","Good job and thorough explanations, i especially liked the Makefile. Keep it up.

"xgossing","Had a nice chat as always. We checked everything , works fine. Well explained . Good job !!"
"xgossing","this evaluation was a very nice refresher course on b2br. Xaver knows how everything works and can explain everything very well. We did everything according to the subject and the evaluation sheet. two parts of the bonus were also done the partitions and the free choice service"
"xgossing","He could explain all of the questions and i had the feeling that he could solved everything
 good luck"
"xgossing","gut gemacht, gute main, gute lange main der fast alles testet, sehr gut"
"xgossing","well well well how the turntables... Xaver was very well prepared, but I still tried to make him a bit nervous as a revenge :)) Still, I found no bugs, everything worked as expected. Good job and see you on born2beroot!"
"xgossing","great work, he knew his code well. Keep up the good work. :) marvin ._. is looking. "

"xgossing","great work but small mistakes :D next try will be perfeto "
"xgossing","Very good code, some minor blunders in ex02 and 04 which can be quickly fixed. Gl! "
"xgossing","You worked well together and the final product, even if not 100% working, is a good achievement. I really think that with slightly more time you could have fixed the bugs and made it almost perfect ;-)
 Next time we'll try that pecan pie and a good dose of adrenaline for me... But also have a look again at those Makefiles, they'll be quite useful in the future!
 Good luck and enjoy your last days of piscine! :))"
"xgossing","explained everything in detail. good luck with moulinette :)"

"xgossing","good work ex00 - ex10"
"xgossing","nice :)"
"xgossing","Nice explanations! Keep going:) The file ex08 is missing :("
"xgossing","seems right"
"xgossing","very nice work sadly missed ? in ex05 "
"xgossing","understood everything there is about pointers? ;) used bubble sort as well for 8, nice because i have no clue how all the others work... very friendly :))"

"xgossing","good work! we checked they seems almost correct and lets see what machine says!"
"xgossing","good work
 good explanation
 :-)
 The last file has too many files"
"xgossing","The project was perfectly done with a perfect explanation, however there was an extra file in the exercise 09.  "
"xgossing","mostly perfect and he knows the errors and will correct it"
"xgossing","perfect and fast"
"xili","we went through the eval sheet and checked everything in detail. Perfect explanation , she knew the commands! Well done "
"xili","Outstanding work! I am impressed with her level of knowledge and how much she researched on the topics of Linux and VMs in general. Definitely one of the best born2beRoot evals I had! Keep it up :)"
"xili","Well done! Answered to all my questions. We had a really nice discussion. Great work:)"
"xili","Very good work, every edgecase was adressed, everthing looks good! good luck :)"
"xili","very nice and friendly. you put a lot of effort in this project and it works as it should. you explained your work perfectly. I really liked your passion on your work! So, that is outstanding for me! Thanks you very much! "
"xili","Very well done and explained. Interesting implementation aswell"
"xili","Was a really nice evaluation, the gnl works as expected. We did some tests and i think it should be accepted by moulinette. "
"xili","Code was exceptionally well explained showing she understood everything and thought things through.
 There was one case we ""debugged"" where for example:
  using gnl(fd);
 gnl(invalid fd);
 gnl(fd); //same from before

 it continued with the 2nd line in this case which might be the correct behaviour. Since nothing is written in the subject and evaluation sheet its undefined and therefore fine for me. "
"xili","Looks good, everything is explained, good luck with moulinette and future projects)"
"xili","Everything looks good, good explanation, good luck!"
"xili","Some creative implementations, clean code structure, maybe some optimizations possible like removing statements that are always true (ft_split), free a NULL-ptr is not necessary, otherwise great work, very friendly and open discussion, good luck for further projects!"
"xili","nice libft, mandatory part meets all criterias, tests passed without errors. Makefile could be revisited for some optimisations, but generally is doing what it is supposed to do. She has a good understanding of her code and what it does, therefore the exchange was fruitful. Good luck further on!"
"xili","creative, unique code, knows what is wrong, went through them and answered all my questions, gl!"
"xili","Good job, except some errors but we discussed it and she understood it well, so good luck for the next time."

"xili","Solid Code. Unfortunelly the ex05 is not norminted . For Ex04 there is alos an extra Header #include ""ft_point.h""
 . Which is in my Opinion should not be there.
 I hope it pases.  "
"xili","Everything looks very good, just there was a problem with the permission of the files. Thank you and good look ;) "
"xili","Unused variable in ex05, otherwise good."
"xili","Haven't done this project yet, so I cannot properly evaluate. However, she was kind and willing to explain."
"xili","Very detailed explanations and she really tries to understand the exercises. Very good job!"
"xili","Wonderful job! , a shame with the small mishap, next try wikll pass for sureeeee"
"xili","you put a lot of efforts in writing your own code - congratulation for that! because it was not easy. Check the Makefile and do not forget to check the norm manually. Also remember writting errors in the right file descriptor. Something that you also have to remember is to check in the man what the fonction you are using is returning on errors and if you should check the return value or not. I appreciated the discussion and your questions. I wish you good luck for the end of your piscine!"
"xili","Good work. Everything seems to be correct."
"xili","Great code! Xin knows how her code works, and can explain it very well!"

"xili","really good code well! nice person :D"
"xili","very clean code and good explanations"
"xili","Good code"
"xili","great group with a good code. Do not forget to check for errors at the beginning for wrong output (negativ numbers, 0) so that you do not go in the loop (here you print \n). If we test the function with INT_MAX we have an infinite loop - think about it when using <= if statements. Except that the squares look nice :) Good lock with the next of your piscine and thanks for your interest during the evaluation!!"
"xili","thank you verz much lil:)"
"xili","everything correct, she explained each excercise well"
"xili","Name on ex02 is sadly wrong, code is good! :("

"xzheng","Some minor mistakes with casting values. She is aware of that. Should be easy fix. Good luck!"
"xzheng","super nice and friendly. we talked about the memcmp because of the last evaluation. Unfortunately I also think that it is not ok (size_t <--> int). The rest of the functions I tested were fine (like ft_split and ft_strtrim). They were well written. You could explain everything so I think you will pass next time for sure. Thank you very much and good luck! ;)"
"xzheng","memcmp had some undesirable issues together with some other functions having (to me) not great practices. I can see though that you gave it a good effort. even if you fail, good job nevertheless. good code for a first attempt, just pay more attention to the mem functions! ;)"
"xzheng","everything clean, good luck on the exam ;)"

"xzheng","good work !! some small mistakes on the ex01! but others looks good!"
"xzheng","Great job, just check the small mistakes!"
"xzheng","unfortunately there was no directory. You forgot to compile with the CFLAGS  and used the wrong compiler and even without them we had warnings. check for the  wrong input at the beginning so that you do not go into your loop and print \n. INT MAX was working :) thanks for your energy and do not be discourage, it is just the beginning. Next time read the subject! Good luck for the next of your piscine :)"
"xzheng","Well done! Deep understanding of code that was written!"
"xzheng","very good explanations and great code"

"yatabay","We had a nice talk. Peer could explain everything that I asked for. He done all three levels in time. Good luck with other evaluators!"
"yatabay","Everything looks good, also very well explained. Great job!"
"yatabay","very good explanation, and very kind."
"yatabay","very nice and friendly. Thank you for the basic introduction to C++ and for explaining the concept of classes in detail. I hope I remember all the information when I am at that point. Unfortunately you forgot to delete the allocated objects in ex00. Besides that the exercises worked as they should and you know what you did. I am pretty sure you will pass next time. Thank you very much and keep it up. Still good work."
"yatabay","Well done project, everything works as it should, only a couple of small issues:
 protectin is missed for WrongCat and Animal in header files
 no free for ex00/main.cpp
 only one test per ex, dont be lazy next time and add few more:)
 Other than that - outstanding, the peer knows the stuff he is doing, keeeeep it up!"
"yatabay","Deepcopy at ex01 segfaults because he used ""this->brain = copy.brain"" instead of ""this->brain = new Brain(*this->brain)"""
"yatabay","sadly in ex00
 ""There should be an example with a WrongAnimal and WrongCat that don't
 use the virtual keyword (see subject)."" But there is WrongAnimal and WrongCat that use the virtual keyword. + in subject there is no a single word about it. :/


 in ex01 this example there is crash
 Dog basic;
 {
 Dog tmp = basic;

 (why this example also not in subject :/ )

 Good Luck next time and with future project's)"
"yatabay","Hello,

 I mean it was interesting to see NetPractice, but tbh. this evaluation is very boring lol. Just running through 3 levels in a limited time especially if the evaluator did't do NetPractice, idk if that's a good idea, but well ig 42 is 42.

 The evaluation sheet itself is also poorly made, like I read the subject yes, but literally if you only read the evaluation sheet then you have absolutely no idea what to actually do :P

 Anyways you were able to complete all 3 random levels in time so I guess clap clap.

 Good luck with the next evaluations .-."
"yatabay","he passed two levels and the time run out in the third level, I wish you look for the next try."
"yatabay","Great explanations, only needed half the time that he had for the 3 levels."
"yatabay","It was a great pleasure to speak with you! Great project!! The code looked clean and easy and good structured! Good and easy explanation of hard work! Good luck for next projects!"
"yatabay","Very nice and friendly (the left one ;)). Your game worked fine and it was a lot of fun to play. Thanks for the explanation and answering my questions. Great job!"
"yatabay","Looks nice; no errors found; shame that some of the bonus features didn't make it though. John Carmack would be proud"
"yatabay","Unfortunately segfault in RGB error handling implementation. Good luck!"
"yatabay","Very cool project guys. Thanks for the intro to cubed and the explanations. Happy coding :)"
"yatabay","Great project! I tested accoriding to the eval sheet and beyond. they also added some extra edge cases. it all worked out as expected. Also no leaks. Checked the code too,they gave me a good overview of the project and answered my question expertly keep it up!"
"yatabay","after reviewing c++ for the third or 4th time now, i must say that im really motivated to learn c++. especially after the enthusiasm brought by the people getting evaluated i start to think that cpp is probably the best project in the whole 42 curriculum. its definitely not repetetive or without any sense for aspiring modern software developers that started learning coding in 1998. after all greatest jobedy job job job wow. cool died. anyways. thats how it goes. anyways spidermonkey "
"yatabay","gute arbeit, alles funktiooniert, get_objekt ist sehr interresant,
 sehr gut"
"yatabay","Awesome work thank you for explaining everything in detail, good to have you back!! "
"yatabay","Everything seems to be working properly, no memory leaks, since no memory was allocated, so well done!)"
"yatabay","Saw Laurent find a mistake in ex02 with swapped < / > operators, all credit goes to him. GL for the next attempt!"
"yatabay","yannis understands c++ and could explain cme everything really well and throughly sadly tho at cpp ex02 he had a relly small issue with the > < operators and mixed one of the up anyways good luck for the next time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
"yatabay","great job, good explainer , he understand his code very well. good luck with next project>>"
"yatabay","very nice and friendly. thank you for teaching me some basics in C++ and explaining your work in detail to me. I hope this will help me soon. Thank you and good luck!"
"yatabay","Exercise 03 doesn't not have a pointer nor a reference to weapon, it is not stated in the subject which should be fixed since the evalsheet is asking explicitly.
 ex04 does not compile because it expects a const char * instead of a string it also doesnt create a new .replace file and it has an endlessloop.
 The last exercise doesnt compile becaue of the pedantic flag no newline at the end. Otherwise good work. Please fix all of the errors even the refrence and pointer now that you know about it. :) "
"yatabay","The explanations were excellent - really, this is how it should be done. Thank you so much for being so patient and clear! Very sad we found a mistake."
"yatabay","Good job, first exercise could be done with strings as well, but it should be fine this way as well, phone book is working properly besides when ^A is inputted: it shifts a little. "
"yatabay","thank you for explaining the phonebook to me. good job."
"yatabay","Thank you two for showing me your legacy project. You will be known for aeons. Young students will sit at the bonfire in what has been known as the basecamp to tell the tale of the fastest minishell in the West.\n
 \n
 \n
 Of course, we went through all the tasks, I had them explain to me all the details, and I went through the code, to see if I could catch some malloc protect errors :) none found!\n
 \n
 I wish you the best for the next projects, and of course, the exam.\n

"yatabay","sehr gut erklärt, alles funktioniert, commands OK, echo, cat, unset, exit code, get grazy, Environment, variables, Pipes, cd, signal handler ist alles OK"
"yatabay","Thank you guys, this eval helped me a lot with understanding this upcoming project.
 Everything looks good to me, did not manage to crash it or find leaks.
 I'll definitely come back to y'all when I have questions:)"
"yatabay","Very intuitive code for an elaborate topic like multi-threading, well done on getting all the tests right."
"yatabay","Great work. No global variables, wow. Oi Kosovo o craddle of freedom,
 Every house holds one flag
 KLA suits you well,
 for homeland blood will spill

 Boys of Kosovo are fighting from Drenica to the mountains of Gjakove, (x2)
 For this land my mother bore me
 For the red and black flag
 I'm a soldier in KLA, I will bring my country freedom"
"yatabay","learned a lot was fun to play whit the functions great explanation keep up the good work"
"yatabay","VERY NICE PROGRAMMED WE CHECKED THROUGH VALGRIND AND VERIOUS OTHER CHECKERS AND TEST....ers ups sorry for caps anyways a nice pushswap he understands coding very good and it was a real experience talkting with him about code he is very passionate. his project swapped the push and pushed the swapp pushedy push swappedy swap you know? anyways very good very nice :thumbs_up: !
 "
"yatabay","Gone precisely through the mandatory part! Discussed a lot! You know your project very well and also your weaknesses! I think it was very beneficial for both! GOOD job yattaby! ;)"
"yatabay","Good job!"
"yatabay","very nice programmed - really clean code - also very good knowledge about the project - very nicely done - good luck! "
"yatabay","good job. keep up the good work. :)"
"yatabay","He talked for an eternity about his project before the evaluation, know his stuff very well. Now I will have to find the keys to my apartment "
"yatabay","Quick and thorough pure genius, where is the database tho?
 "
"yatabay","Even as someone who is a couple of projects behind Neo was able to explain whole code blocks to me. You can clearly see the passion and dedication behind every step. Thank you :) "
"yatabay","Great work! Especially liked how you handled to put the game in the middle of the window. Great idea to use structures.
 The whole project was very well structured with good and fitting naming of variables, files and functions. The whole code is quite easy to understand thanks to that.
 Explained everything nicely and thoroughly.
 Thank you for the very friendly and nice evaluation session!!"
"yatabay","very comprehensive explanation. he went through all his work step by step!
 great work! "
"yatabay","Explained everything VERY GOOD! Excellent codes as far as I can tell. Thanks and good luck!"
"yatabay","Very well explained !! Super friendly."
"yatabay","all but bonus"
"yatabay","Great codes to my understanding. Explained everything well - also went through the edge-cases. Good luck with moulinette and the upcoming projects :D"
"yatabay","Very good coder. Clearly has a lot of experience. You have done a great job on your project. Everything was very readable and you managed to explain your code well. If you stop overcomplicating things you're going to be unstopable! Keep it up Yannis :)"
"yatabay","Thanks for all the details. Even if i did not get all of i saw that you make efforts and knows your subject very well."
"yatabay","Good job. Good explanation :) "
"yatabay","Well done!"
"yatabay","Had some memory errors, not sure if that is evaluated by moulinette, so I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt, GL ;)"
"yatabay","we have tested with Francinette, there were some Memory errors, but this should not be tested by moulinette. the ft_itoa.c ft_substr.c had memory errors, and with another tester ft_strchr.c and ft_strrchr.c had some problems. manual tests were ok."
"yatabay","Well-explained, great project, good luck!"
"yatabay","Impressive knowledge and good + enthusiastic explanations! Thanks a lot and good luck!"
"yatabay","Good luck whit molinete "
"yatabay","Nice work! to lazy to do the last one 😝. Keep going^^"
"yatabay","Good code and explanation on the exxercises. ex03 is missing!"
"yatabay","very good code)))"
"yatabay","Great job! The logic in the last task is super. "
"yatabay","The team worked separately but managed to bring a semi-working program. The logic had to be refined and some error testing could have prevented many crashes. No leaks 👍. Very messy submission, couldn't see the source code, couple of Norme error and still some misunderstanding about the Makefile. Don't forget to check after the pointer after malloc!
 You seemed to have had fun and I hope you learned new concepts.
 Good luck for the last week!
 Good job :)))"
"yatabay","Great clean code :)"
"yatabay","Unfortunately a few mistakes."
"yatabay","Interesting approach with the putnbr function. great work!"
"yatabay","great, nicely done. don't be that lazy "
"yatabay","Great work! ;)"

"yatabay","Good job :)"
"yatabay","Good job!"
"yatabay","Good job! Best of luck."
"yatabay","Good job, hopefully moulinnette won’t break it :D"
"yatabay","good code"
"yatabay","I loved the human-robot approach, surely with more time and a RAM upgrade it would have worked fine. Not very scalable though... The code was clean and the team worked together. In the end you did a good job! Have a look at this memory stuff and recursion. Have a great day! Good luck! 🍀"
"yatabay","well done!"
"yatabay","very clean code! thank you for explaining it to me so clearly :)"

"yatabay","GLHF man ! wp"
"yatabay","GL Hf"
"yatabay","MY MAN! Almost! Good job."
"yatabay","Perfect! Good knowledge of code, provided some useful tips! :)"
"yatabay","The group submitted the rush in the wrong folder, there were some problems with negative y and the rush function name was wrong HOWEVER, they looked pretty acknowledged about what they did and the code compiled and worked.
 It could have been a little more readable.
 Good job anyways
