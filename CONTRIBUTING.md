# Contributing to 42-stats
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
*  Reporting a bug
*  Discussing the current state of the code
*  Submitting a fix
*  Proposing new features
## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
We use [GitHub FLow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html): All Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase, they are always welcome:
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you have added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the tests pass.
4.  Make sure your code is formatted correctly: we use [Black]([url](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)).
5.  Submit the pull request!
## Any Contributions You Make Will be under the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) Software License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project.
## Report Bugs using GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/42-stats/42-stats/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening an issue](https://github.com/42-stats/42-stats/issues); it's very easy!
## Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background and Sample Code!
**Good Bug Reports** tend to have:
*  A quick summary and/or background
*  Steps to reproduce
*    Be specific!
*    Give sample code if you can.
*  What you expected would happen
*  What actually happens
*  Notes, for example:
*    What you think might be happening
*    Stuff you tried that did not work

The more thorough the bug report, the easier the fix ðŸ«€
## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) Python formatter.
**How to use Black:**
*  Read the [doc](https://black.readthedocs.io/)
*  Alternatively, `pip install black`
*  run `black` on your source directory, eg:
```sh
black src
```
